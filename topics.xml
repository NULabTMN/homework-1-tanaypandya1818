          A French paper eaya The colossal
          statue of "Liberty Lighting tho
          World, erected by France and Ameri
          ca in remembrance of their old friend
          ship, is coming ont little by little from
          the immense workshops established

          ped of the Fcaffolding which surrounds

          are at work. The first sentiment in
          spired by tho enormous head, nearly
          thirty feet high, is almost terror. Its
          gigantic dimensions are stupefying; but
          ujr uegrees mo eye Decomes accustomed
          to the colossal forms, and the mind
          reconciles itself to the extent of those
          great lines, and we discover in the midst
          of them the majesty and the light
          which the author has endeavored to give
          ti the features. But the publio will
          soon have an opportunity to see the beau

        <text>OUR PARIS LETTER.
          The head of the new Colossus,
          *'Liberty," which is in future to
          light all nations into the harbor of
          New York, has produced a profound
          impression on the visitors to the
          Exhibition. It is placed on the
          left-hand side of the grounds of the
          Champ de Mar's, looking towards
          the Seine. The face is very fine
          somewhat resembling that of the
          Apollo Belridere, and the effect from
          the othr side of the grounds, two
          thousand feet off, or so, is remark
          ably grandL- For the first time a
          modern sculptor has achieved that
          in which the' Greeks seemed to fink?
          no difficulty whatever, namely, the
          necessary exaggeration of parts to
          produce effect at a great distance.
          M. Bartholdi has had a great success
          so far. The astonishment of the
          mass of visitors is amusing, and
          their presence serves to bring out to
          an observer the full grandeur of the
          work by comparison. A staircase
          is established within the head, and
          hundreds of visitors ascend every
          hour, while thousands wait their
          turn. The staircase leads up to the
          eyes of the figures, which serve as
          windows. From head to foot, half
          the height of the Monument of Lon
          don the arm which holds a "flam-
          beau," that is to say the lantern of
          the lighthouse, measures forty feet
          but the details read even more curi
          ously. Thus, the arms measure
          riearly seven feet in diameter, the
          hand is more than fourteen feet
          long, and twenty inches in diameter
          lastly, the finger nail measures more
          than fourteen inches by twelve. The
          platform which is to surround the
          lantern, will measure nearly four
          feet in width and will hold ten per
          sons, and allow space for them to
          circulate without difficulty. The
          head is surrounded by rays] whicit.
          lire to be illuminated.
          The Colossus is to stand on a base
          e'rec ed on a rock, the base, contain
          ing the keepers residence and the ac
          cessories of a lighthouse. This base
          will measure more than eighty feet
          high, so that the top of the head of
          the figure will be little short of two
          hundred feet from the ground.
          The whole is formed of sheets of
          copper reponse and bolted together,
          and the quantity of metal required
          will bo thirty tons while the iron
          framework, including the .stair-ease
          within the statue, wiil weigh about
          seventy tons more.
          T'he statue of the Republic, a grand
          seated figure, by Clesinger, which, is
          placed in the terrace before the chief
          entrarJc'C of Exhibition, is, with ita
          blinth, about the height of the face
          of the Colossus. M. Clesinger is said
          to have received 800 for his wofk.
          Sculpture is certainly in the as
          cendant just now in France, last
          year, a sculptor, M. Chapu, took
          one' of the Grands Prix d' Honneur
          and the Prix du Salon, a traveling
          scholarship, and this year the Salon
          juries have awarded both of the
          Grands Prix, as well as the Prix du
          Salon to sculptorsM. M. Barrias,
          Belaplanche and Hector Lemaire.
          The group in bronze which won M.
          Mercie the Prix d' Honneur in 1874,
          is perhaps the most remarkable ex
          ample of the sculptor's art produced
          in France since the last Exhibition
          it consists of two figures, an angel,
          bearing the dead body of a Warrior,
          with broken sword still clutched in
          his hand, with wings oiitstrechect,
          and feet just about to quit the earth
          the figure of the angel is remarkably
          noble, and admirably posed. This
          work stands at the present in the
          central garden, in the Champ de
          Mars, building, but is to be erected
          in the Square Montholon.
          A trial of ploughs on a large scale
          recently took place with the authori
          zation of M. Krautz, at VelitBrurg,
          near Ivry, on the Lyons Line, on
          the farms of M. Decanville, who
          worthily inherits from his father
          the title of one of the most eminent
          agriculturists iu France. M. De
          canville is a large purchaser of
          American agricultural implements,
          and habitually uses on his property
          both steam ploughs, as well as
          steam-rollers, scarifiers, and barrows
          of American manufacture. All these
          we're in full work at the trial, and
          nearly monopolized thefattention of
          the wondering peasantry, who flock
          ed in great numbers from neighbor
          ing communes. The rapidity and
          neatness with which steam-ploughs
          do their work make spectators mai*
          vel that any others can be used,
          but the prime cost of the
          machinery is a great ir con
          sideration to small farmers. There
          were plenty of* more old-fashioned
          specimens of agricultural labor to
          be criticised: four-horoe and two
          horse ploughs four-ox and two-ox
          ploughs and one plough with six
          heavy horses and seven men whose
          performance was generally "por-
          nounced a sad waste of labor, especi
          ally as, a pair of oxen side by side
          with one man seemed to plough quite
          as deep and good a furrow. The
          jurors, among whom where the Sena
          tors Feray and Toucher de Caveil,
          who both are stated to be landowners
          in the department, will not give
          their verdict for some days. Some
          Arab chiefs, wearing many decora
          tions, and three Chinese of high rank
          walked after the plows and partook
          of a breakfast given by M. Decan
          ville.
          One of the most striking charac
          teristics of the Exhibition'buildings
          is the emproyment of terracotta and
          enamelled earthenware in their deco
          rations. This employment meets
          the ejTe
          almost everywhere. The
          front and back of the building on
          the Champ de Mars have series of pi
          lasters decorated with square slabs of
          brightly colored faience the. orna
          mentation consisting cf two designs
          alternating with each other, one
          composed principally of :birds, and
          the other of fruits and foliage- One
          of the most remarkable colors in
          these slabs is a fine bright red, and
          this is said to have been discovered
          during the- experiments made, with
          the view to the production of the
          slabs in question. Another applica
          tion of decorative pottery is to be
          seen around the doors of the pavil
          lion of the City of Paris, in the en
          closed garden in the autre of the
          Champ de Mars, where is 'a double
          border of large square slabs, terra
          cotta and faience, in reality I believe
          only immitations in plaster. But
          the most remarkable application is
          that on the fronts of the pavillions
          of the fine art galleries which face
          the doors of the city pavillion. These
          are works of great magnitude each
          front consist of three arches, the
          central one pierced below with a
          door. Over the door and on each
          side of the northern porch, are fig
          ures of poetry, painting, and other
          arts, larger than life, and three land
          scapes of great area, with a grand
          expanse of sea, a village on the cliffs
          architectural motives amidst grand
          trees, decorative colors, and other
          elements. All this is executed in
          large tiles and with much success.
          The blues and greens in the coloring
          are remarkably fine, and the firnig
          shows very few faults while the tiles
          are so flat and regular, that the joints
          are only apparent at a very-short dis-
          tance. ALPHA.</text>

          Public sentiment hbar been thorough
          ly aroused at last, ini favor of the move
          ment toward the erectingof Bartholdl's
          statute, "Liberty Enlightening the
          World," inu the harbor of New York.
          Americans now understand that those
          among them who subscribe to the
          completion of this grand work, will
          perform an act of patriotism, and at
          the same time one of International
          comity worthy of the enlightened
          ideas permesting this nineteenth
          century.
          Some idea of the extent of the pub
          lic sentiment is shown by the fact tbat
          the New York World has been able to
          report subscriptions of over $30,000 in
          a month's time, in sums averaging
          less than $1" each, the great bulk of
          these contributions being in dimes
          and quarters.
          What a aiagniflcent object it will be,
          towering almost into the clouds from
          New York's beautiful harbor I It will
          stand as a grand symbol of liberty be
          fore the eyes of every one coiaiug froll
          the oppressed countries beyond the
          ocean. At the gateway of no other
          nation oould it stand with such ap
          propriateness. Here it symbolizes the
          fullest achievement of human freedom
          and will forever stand to tell that story.
          The committee in charge of the erec
          tion of the pedestal for the reception
          of this great work have prepared a
          beautiful statuette, as a souvenir tb

          ings of modern times and eminently
          fitting that it should be built from the
          hearts and pockets of our people.
          The committee does not believe the
          American people are indifferent to
          this great work, therefore calls upon
          them for their aid. Every person
          wishing to secome a sobscribershould

        <text>BARTHOLDI'S STATUE.
          Liberty Enlightening the World.
          This now Wonder of the World, which is
          now being loaded on the French transport lsere
          for shipment to this country, is tho largest
          statue in tho world. Somo idea of its magni
          tude may bo obtained from tho fact that 40
          persons found standing room within the head.
          A six-foot man standing on tho level of tho
          lip3 only just reached the eyebrow. Whilo
          workmen wero employed on the crown of her
          head they seemed to bo making a huge sugar
          caldron, and they jumped with caso in and out
          tho tip of tho nose. Fifteen pcoplo might sit
          round tho flame of tho torch, which elevation
          can bo reached by a spiral staircase within tho
          outstretched arm.
          Tho London Daily Ncics, in speaking of it,
          says It is out aud away the largest statue of
          modern times. Tho Colossus of Rhodes was
          nothing to it. It could carry tho 'Bavaria' or
          tho 'Hermann' in its arms. It towers to tho
          skies from tho yard of the Ruo do Chazelles,
          whoro it has been eight years in construction,
          and tho view from its coronet sweeps clear of
          the six-story hbuses and beyond tho walls of
          Paris."
          Tho weight of this stupendous statuo is 440,
          000 pounds, of which 170,000 pounds are cop
          per and tho remainder wrought-iron. It is
          expected to arrivo in New York about the 25th
          of May, whero it will bo erected ou Bedloe's
          Island, this being the location selected for it by
          Gen. W. T. Sherman, who was appointed by tho
          President to mako the selection. When placed
          in position it will loom up 305 feot above tide
          water, tho hight of tho statuo being 151.2 feet,
          that of tho pedestal 91 feet, aud foundation
          52.10 feet.
          This imposing statue, higher than tho enor
          mous towers of the great Brooklyn Bridge or
          the steeple of Trinity Church, which is tho
          loftiest in tho city of New York, higher, in
          fact, than any of tho colossal statues of anti
          quity by its rare artistic proportions, as well
          as by its stupendous dimensions, will add an
          other to tho Wonders of the World. A word
          should bo said of its artistic "merit. The pose,
          stride, and gesture, with its classic face, aro
          pronounced perfect; the drapory is both mass
          ive and fine, and in some parts is as dclicato
          and silky in effect asif wrought with a fino
          chisel on tho smallest scale.
          The committco in charge of the construction
          of the baso and pedestal for tho reception of
          this great work aro in want of funds for its
          completion, and have prepared a miniaturo
          statuct, an exact counterpart of tho original,
          six inches in hight, tho ilguro being made of
          bronze, the pedestal of nickel silver, which
          they aro now delivering to subscribers through
          out tho United States for tho small sum of $1
          each. Aside from its being a lasting souvenir
          of this colossal statue, it will ornament onr
          homes and bear testimony that wo have con
          tributed to tho completion of ono of the grand
          est works of&amp;modcrn times. All remittances
          should bo addressed to, Richard Butler, Secre

        <text>BARTHOLDtni BIG CIRC.
          T&amp;e Prejudices Met By a Canvasser
          the Pedestal Fund.
          The Bartholdi pedestal fund is nearly
          complete. The statue has arrived and
          soon New York harbor will be graced
          by the most magnificent colossal statue
          the world has ever seen.
          "Liberty Enlightening the World!"
          What a priceless blessing personal li
          Derty is. It is the shrine at whiclf
          people, ground under the heel of ty
          ranny in the older worlds,, worship
          with a fervency that Americans can
          scarcely realize it is a principle for
          which Nihilists willingly die the death
          of dogs andfitand proper it is that
          at the very entrance of the Bay of New
          York this emblematic statue should
          flash a welcome to the world.
          The press is entitled to the credit of
          this achievement Mr. Philip Beers,
          who has been making a circuity of the
          country on. behalf of the Pedestal fund,
          says that the fund will certainh be
          raised, as the World does not know the
          fail.
          Mr. Beers says that he has found the
          most pronounced generosity anion*
          those of foreign birth. They seem
          more appreciative of liberty than
          do our native born Moreover,
          among some a strange prejudice seems
          to exist
          "Prejudice?' In what particular3*'
          "I have ever found that however
          meritorious a thing may be, thousands
          of people will inevitable be prejudiced
          against it I have spent most of niv
          life on the road and I know the Ameri
          can people 'like a book.' In 1879 a
          personal misfortune illustrated this
          prevailing prejudice. I was very ill,
          had suffered for several ears" with
          headache, iickle appetite, dreadful
          backache, cramps, hot head, cold hands
          and teet and a general break down of
          the system. I dragged mj self back to
          New York, seeking the best profession
          al treatment. It so happens that among
          my relatives is a distinguished phys
          cian who upbraided me roundly "for
          preaching so much about rus own case.
          Finnallv, with some spnit, I remarked
          to him:
          '"Sir, you know that much of jour
          professional wisdom is pretense. You
          are controlled by prejudice. You
          cannot reach a case like mine and you
          know it. can you?""
          "I had him and he finally conceded
          the point, for it was bright's disease of
          the kidneys which had prostrated me,
          and the schoolmen admit they jjcannot
          enre it. Having cured myself, howev
          er, in 1879, and not having seen a sick
          day since, my relative finally admitted
          that Warner's safe cure, which accom
          plished this result, was really a wonder
          ful preparation. Had President Butter,
          the Central-Hudson used it, I am
          certain he would be alive to-day, for he
          could not have been in a worse condi
          than I was."
          "I have found similar prejudices a
          mong all classes concerning even so
          laudable a scheme as the pedestal
          fund."
          Mr. Beers"s experience and the re
          cent death of President Butter, of the
          Central-Hudson railtoad, of an extreme
          kidney disorder, proves that the phjsi
          cians have no real power over such dis
          eases, and indicates the only course
          one should pursue if, as the late Dr.
          Willard Parker saj-s, headache, sick
          ness of the stomach, dropsical swel
          lings, back ache, dark and offensive
          fluids, prematurely impaired ej esight,
          loss of strength and energj' occur, for
          they unmistakably indicate a fatal re
          sult, if not promptly arrested.
          "Yes, sir-ee, every cent needed for
          the pedestal will be raised. Of course
          it will be a great triumph for theare
          World, but would it not have been an
          eternal disgrace had our people failed
          to provide for this pedestal?"</text>

        <text>THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.
          HOW IT WAS. MAIiK ANI PUT IN 1T.ACI'..
          Tho Now York Tribune thus ro
          vlowfl tho history of the great work of
          M. Bartholin which was unveiled ou
          Thursday of last week in tho Now
          York hnrhor.
          Tho history of tho Ilartholdi stntuo
          from iiri"t to last is a checkered ono and
          goes back through nil sorts of delays
          and difficulties lor almost twenty yoaw.
          It was, strangely enough, just at tho
          closo of tho disastrous war with Ger
          many and while tho horrors of tho
          Commune wcro still raging in Paris
          that M. Lahoulnye, tho founder of tho
          French-American Union, first definito
          ly broached his jutriotio project of
          building in this country a joint memo
          rial of the struggles of tho French and
          Americans in tho Uovolution, and sent
          tho young sculptor Bartholdi to thu
          United States to find, if possible, Homo
          suitablo and happy idea. Tho first
          suggestion of tho statue, perhaps, dates
          still further back to a dinner given un
          der thu Empiro by M. Laboulayo at his
          country house, "Glavigny, near Ver
          sailles. St. l.AIIOUt.AYll's IIOI'KS AND I'ANCIKS.
          It was at that dinner nt Glavigny in
          1885, as Bartholdi himself says, that
          his mind was first turned in tho direc
          tion it was afterward so devotedly and
          enthusiastically to follow. The after
          dinner talk of 31. Iaboulayo's guests
          had fallen upon gratitudo between na
          tions. Soma ono said that such a thing
          as national gratitudo could not exist.
          Italy no longer felt grateful for tho
          good officers of France in 1859; even
          with the Uuiled States Franco could
          no moro count on tho remembrance of
          the past.
          This 31. Laboulayo stoutly protested
          against. Whatever might bo tho case
          witli Italy, he said, with America
          Francohad still a greater sympathy
          than with any European nation. Amer
          ica's feeling toward France, too, was
          not ono of simple gratitudo. It was
          based on tho lemenibranco of a, com
          munity of thought and struggles and
          aspirations. And when hearts had
          oneo beaten together something always
          remained behind among nations as
          among individuals. This, ho contin
          ued, was tho basis of tho sentiment
          felt in tho United States toward
          Frauce,a sentiment honorable to Amer
          icans as well as French, and if a mon
          ument weio to bo built in America as
          a memorial of independence it would
          bo most natural to havo it built by a
          united effort, to make it the common
          work of both nations.
          Fivo years after, in tho midst of tho
          war with Germany, Bartholdi found
          himself recurring again to this con
          versation. The war was soon over and
          his uative province, Alsace, shut against
          liim. Ho resolved to travel for a year
          and visit the country in which his in
          terest had been so sharply aroused.
          In a month or two ho found himself
          again at 31. Labotilaye's house near
          Versailles. With him were 31. Lafa
          yette, Henri 3Iartin, Bomusat, Volow
          ski and DeGaspariu. Tho talk turned
          onco more on tho feeling of America
          for France. 3L Laboulayo took up
          his old viows agaiu and declared that
          without a doubt by 1870 there would
          bo a strong pavdotio and French inovo
          raent in America.
          'Go to seo that country," he said to
          Bartholdi. "You will study it, and
          bring back your impressions. Pro
          pose to our friends over there to tuako
          a monument in commcn in remem
          brance of tho ancient friendship be
          tween France and tho United Slates.
          Wo will take up a subscription in
          France. If yon find a happy idea, wo
          aro convinced that it will bo successful
          on both continents, and wo shall do a
          work which will have a far-icaching
          moral effect.
          Bartholdi tells all this in his modest
          little sketch of the work of tho French
          Committee. And in thepo two convei-
          satinns at 31. Labotilaye's the germ of
          tho French-American Union's project
          may bo found.

          Tho sculptor thought over noma
          plans for the proposed monument on
          tho way out, but only hazily. Suddon

          steaming up through tho Narrows into
          New x oik my, tho moment ot inspi

          fancy tho maiestio figure of Liberty
          towering with her torch over tho bas

          crowded harbor, with its tributary riv
          ers aud tho vast, blackhued cities on
          their borders, tho very imago of a
          teeming, populous miniature world.

          ticularly and in Philadelphia to whom
          31. Laboulayo had given him loiters of
          introduction, ho soon disoovercd that
          ho could look for support in the United
          States that, as ho says, the draft
          drawn by tho French Committeo on
          American sentiment would not ho pro
          tested. M. Laboulayo had had somo
          correspondence already with John Jay
          and others respecting tho monument;
          hut though tho interest which Barthol
          di mentions was no doubt arouset', no
          formal nction was taken until tho
          soulptor's second vis'r, here,
          TI1K rltKXCI.ASi:UIU.VN 1'NlOK.
          Going back to France, Bartholdi run
          over his impressions lo 31, Laboulayo
          and his friends, and laid beforo them
          tho plan for a stntuo iu Now York
          harbor. Thoy udoptvd it with enthusi
          asm, A committee was organized tin
          der tho name of tho Fronch-Ainerican
          Union, and Bartholdi set to work to
          mako his first models. Tho full plan
          of tho Union was made public at tho
          and of 1871, and subscription lists
          wp0 soon peculating throughout
          Kiaiice. A good ileal of money oamo
          in at onco mid moro was promised.
          Tho actual moulding of tho hugo
          cast began in 1875, Tho birth of tho
          stntuo was celebrated on November Oth
          of that year by a dinner nt tho Hotel
          du Louvre, at which tint Aaicrioan
          Minister, 3Ir. Washbunu', and all tho
          prominent memhets of tho French
          Amerioan Union wcro present. Tho
          ritrht liund of tho goddess was struck
          off in its colossal proportions nnd Bent
          to the Centennial Exhibition at Phila
          delphia iu 1870.
          5, 1886.
          Bartholdi himself camo over in that
          year ns one of tho French jury for tho
          eihihitlon. Tho unveiling of his stat-
          no oi littayette, which was oruorcd by
          tho Fronoh Government as a gift to
          tho city of Now York In acknowledg
          ment of the rolief sent to Paris after
          tho siege, nnd which now stands in
          Union Square, gavo him an opportuni
          ty to push matters among ins Now
          York friends.
          A call for a meeting nt tho Century
          Club was issued by William 31. Ev
          arts, John Jay, W. II. Wickham, S. D.
          Babcoek, William II. Appleton and
          Kiohard Butler. There tho plau of
          tho French committeo was talked over
          with Bartholdi aud Hocharabcau and
          an American committee was organized.
          .Mr. Evarte was its chairman nnd Rich
          ard Butler its secretary. Sub-committees
          wero appointed and weekly meet
          ings wcro held for a tnno. Tho ques
          tion of procuring legislation from Con
          gress was tho most important.
          After somo drawbacks and delnys, a
          joint resolution was introduced accept
          ing tho statue and setting apart n silo
          on either Governor's or Bedlow's Is
          land for tho statue, and on February
          22, 1877, it passed both Houses. Gen
          eral W. T. Sherman was sent on to do
          cide between thu two, and wisely con
          firmed Bartholdi's choice. Fort Wood
          was given up as a military post and
          turned over to the uso of the Ameri
          can committee.
          TAnnv mtowTii ov the statuk.
          Bartholdi went back to Franco in
          tho fall of 187G Tho political crisis
          that camo toward tho end of 31ac3Ia
          hon's Presidency had bad a disastrous
          effect on tho affairs of the French
          American Union. Subscriptions had
          almost ceased to come in nnd word was
          sent to tho American committeo that
          tho work on the foundation and pedes
          tal of tho statue bad better bo post
          poned for a year or two. It was not
          until 1879 that money enough was
          raised in Frauco to pay tho baro ex
          penses of the work on tho statue.
          Iu 1878, however, Bartholdi, san
          guine nnd undaunted as ever, executed
          tho head for tho Paris Exposition.
          The other parts followed at intervals,
          and by July, 1880, tho French com
          mittee saw its way clear to report sub
          stantial progress to tho American com
          mittee aud to fix a probable date for
          tho completion of tho statue. On Oc
          tober 24, 1881, tho anniversary of the
          surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown
          all the pieces of tho framework and of
          tho baso were put in place, and Levi
          P. 3Iorton, then United States Minister
          to France, was invited to drive tho riv
          et of tho first piece which was to bo
          mounted. Tho statue was nearly fin
          ished in 1883, but tho work on the pe
          destal here was so backward that it
          was decided to leave tho completed
          goddess on exhibition for awbilo iu
          Paris.
          Finally, on July 4,lS84,Count Ferdi
          nand do Lessops, who had succeeded
          31. Laboulayo as President of tho
          French Committee, turned the statuo
          over iorracrlly to tho Unitod States
          through 3Ir, 3Iorton. It stood six
          months longer waiting for tho comple
          tion of tho pedestal. It seemed for a
          tlmo that it would havo to wait torov
          cr, and tho work of taking it down was
          beguu in January, 1883, with many
          misgivings. Tho pieces wero packed
          carefully in 210 cases and stowed on
          board tho French man-of-war Isero at
          Rouen. Tho statuo was insured for
          about half its value.
          Tho Isero had an extremely rough
          voyago nnd had to put back onco to
          Rouen to escape a storm. Outside tho
          harbor of New York sho was met by
          the French North Atlantic Squadron,
          under Admiral La Combe, and escort
          ed into tho bay with flying colors.
          The Isero reached Now York iu June,
          188.). Tho pieces of tho statue wero
          lightered over to Bedlow's Island and
          wero stored thero until 3Iay last, when
          the work ot setting up tho great cop
          per goddess for the last time was begun.
          Till! AMERICAN COMMITTEE'S TKIAI.S.
          Tho American committee could do
          nothing, of Course, after obtaining tho
          grant of a sito from Congress, but wait
          for tho signal from 31. Bartholdi and
          his friends to break ground for tho
          statue's pedestal. In 1882 somo pre
          liminary steps wero taken. A publio
          meeting was held in tho Academy of
          3Iusio on November 2i? of that year,
          and tho taking of subsciiptions was
          pushed vigorously.
          Iho Mow York Legislature passed a
          bill appropriating $."0,000 for tho work
          on tho pedestal. But Governor Clove
          land vetoed it, to tho great disgust
          of tho managers of tho Pedestal Fund,
          as unconstitutional. A still greater
          disappointment camo with tho winter
          ot lH84.ii. A bill appropriating SI 00-
          000 was introduced during tho short
          session of Congress, nnd failed through
          the neglect of tho Committeo on Ap
          propriations to insert tho item in their
          mat report.
          Work on tho foundation inside tho
          old fort was begun in tho spring of
          1883, an. I the loundnttou itself was
          finished hetoro tho end of that year.
          In tho spring of 1881 tho corner-stone
          of tho pedestal was laid, aud a fow
          tiers of granite wero nddod now nnd
          then from inonlh to month. Tho first
          bit of enthusiasm was over, and tho
          subscription list hung fire. Statuettes
          and photographs wero slruok off by
          tho committeo and offered for sale, but
          tho returns grow smaller nnd smaller.
          One hundred aud sovo'nty-fivo thous
          and dollars had been raised by tho
          summer of 188(, and tho committee's
          persuasive powers wero apparently ex
          hausted, Its run of bni luck could
          not ho broken.
          In 3Iarch, 1885, when tho statuo was
          almost ready for shipmeut, and tho
          American committee, in a state of
          thickening despair, tho Now York
          World unexpectedly undertook to
          raiso tho $100,000 Btill needed, and
          opened a subscription list of its own
          for that purpose. By Julv a total of
          S102, 000.30 was turned into tho Po-
          destal Fund. This tided tho commit
          teo over tho fall and winter of 1885,
          nun sorvoit, indeed, to hnUh tho mas
          sivo pedestal in April, 18S0.
          I ho iron framework nnd braces lor
          tho support of tho stntuo wero put up
          in may ami June, and on July l'.'th
          tho work on tho copper plating itself
          was begun, 3Inny of tho huge pieoos
          boxed up so long, shaken about in so
          many handlings nnd exposed to a great
          variety ot temperatures, had flattened
          out of their original shape. There
          was a great deal of delay from tltno to

          For tho last month or moro almost
          dally nolo has been mado of tho slow
          progress of riveting tho vast copper
          shout hi r together and tho gradual
          softening of tho heavy lines and sur
          faces which looked so coarso and vague
          aground, to tho easy, graceful, airy
          symmetry of tho splendid figure as it
          now stands. Tho statuo was practi
          cally finished on October 1G. From
          that day, at least, tho Amoricnn com
          mittee will always dato its first mo

          THE SITE AND TUB POUNIIATION.
          BjrthoHi himself choso Bedlow's Is.
          land fifteen years ago for tho sito of
          his great monument. No spot, in fact,
          could havo been n happier ono for tho
          purpose. From tho shores of the Bay
          tho level islet looks like tho mere natu
          ral baso of the vast statuo and its solid-faced
          pedestal.
          Cut away from any rival objects
          largo or small, dwarfed or dwaifitiir.
          tho colossal figure stands clearly against
          the freo back-ground of water, land
          and sky, bletidiug with them easily nnd
          simply, liko an imago drawn, as tho
          goddtss is, on their own scale. And
          if tho great bronzo figure Ills, liko ono
          of its own rivetB in tho copper sheath,
          into the surroundings of sea and sky,
          tho granite pedestal finds aready-mado
          support to tho double star-shaped inner
          walls of old Fort Wood
          Tho base of tho pedestal is almost
          hidden from the outside behind them,
          and when tho old parado ground is
          filled in, and tho sodded tcrraco slopes
          gently downward from the crown of
          tho foundation over them to the sea
          wall below, thoir tops will mako an
          easy break halt-way whero Iho stair
          cases will broaden out into spacious
          platforms, and benches will bo ranged
          for loiterers in tho pleasant weather.
          Tho outworks of tho fort have disap
          peared i so have tho powder-houses
          and tho sally-ports. Tho baBtions
          themselves will soon bo buried in tho
          dirt. Only the small sea battery with
          its guns freshly polished for display,
          net use, will be left to remind one in a
          year or two that Bedlow's Island was
          once a Govortiment post.
          The bulk of tho pedestal's founda
          tion will, of course, be out of sight
          when the landscape gardener has fin
          ished his work ou the approaches to
          tho statue. It starts, in fact, beneath
          the old parado ground, at thirteen feet
          above tho mean low water mark. In
          shape it is something liko a truncated
          pyramid, with a gentle slope.
          It does not rise, however, with a
          continuous wall, but with a series of

          greav layers oi concrete, each one a
          trifle smaller than the one it rests up
          on. Tho top reaches up above tho fort
          walls fifty-two feet ten inchos from tho
          baso. There is no break to the very
          top. The whole thing is a vast mass
          of concrete and rock, which measures
          on its upper face about sixty-fivo feet
          square.
          A WELL 11UILT PEDESTAL.
          Tho pedestal proper at its baso is
          sixty-two feet square, and begins at an
          elevation above tide-water or sixty-fivo
          feet. In the middle of each face, just
          on a leval with the proposed terrace,
          is doorway, fivo feet wido and thir
          teen feet high. On each-side of every
          door is a projecting disk of stone on
          which tho arms of the United States
          and of Franco will bo cut in lelief.
          Abovu the doors is a broad band of
          stono running around tho pedestal and
          broken into forty smooth faced medal
          lions, ten on each Bide, on which the
          coats-of-arms of tho various States will
          probably bo placed. Still higher than
          tho medallions aro four largo nanols.
          twenty-threo feet and six inches long
          and fivo feet and three inches from top
          to bottom. Theso will also bo covered
          with appropriate inscriptions and de
          signs.
          Whero tho walls io:n again thero s
          a jutting frieze of plain L-ranite, crown
          ed with a low open balcony on which
          lour aooi's open again Irom the shaft
          within. Hero tho third section begins.
          Tho walls contract several feet, though
          tho balcony rail breaks tho sharpness
          cf tho effect from below. It is but a
          few tiers now to the top of tho pedes
          tal, hid from viow by tho rich drapery
          of the goddess's tunic. Tho topmost
          platform is thirty-nino feet and four
          and threo eighths inches squaro and
          io leoi nuovo low-water m,rk,
          Tho pedestal is in its way a most
          graceful and modest structure. It, is
          neither monotonous or heavy, and has
          been raado to look smaller than it
          really is. Tho goddess, in fact gains
          n point ot elevation by this suppress-
          ion, and towers over everything else,
          but tho effect is in no wav forced or
          stilt-like. Tho soft gray shado of tl o
          pedestal blonds well with tho reddish
          brown of the copper, nnd the whiteness
          of tho rough quoins shows far aoross

          pedestal cost in all about $250,000.

          Tho Goddess of Libertv is tho larg

          Tho colossal statuo ot Arnuntus, iu Ba

          Nr.w York, Oct. 28. The rain, which
          fell almost continuously for thirty-six
          hours, did not ce.ie until about daylight
          this morning. The sky did not clear,
          however, ami the thonautls of anxious
          sightseers who began to pour Into the
          streets at an early hour met. a I;imp, fos
          gy atmosphere, which threatened a re
          newal of rain at any moment.
          The storm greatly Interfered with
          the work on Bedloe's Island yesterday,
          but ns little t.t.s left to" do. it
          did not mailer very much whether it
          I rained or not. The woikmen tore down
          the old, narrow steps thai led up the em
          j banknient ami replaced tnem with :i
          wilier and more substantial stairwav.
          j They also laid a broad wooden walk lead
          ing to tnc ;:rouuu entrance to the front
          of the fort. The plat
          form that has stood
          in one ot the north
          western angles of the
          Inclosurewas remov
          ed and the nlatfurm
          for the speakers
          made ready for their
          reception. A hand
          some Mik French flair
          will no placed over
          the face of the statue.
          At a word from Pres

          will be drawn, iinvcil-
          tiik f.ici:. ins the head of the
          poiMcss.
          Between 8 and 9 o'clock all thorough
          fares showed signs of unusual activity.
          All trains were ciowded to their utmost
          capacity wilh people hurrying to advanta
          geous noints to vie w the gi and procession.
          Iu the vicinity of Filth avenue and
          Filty-.'oventh .-treet, the point at whicn
          the procession wns to form, all was bustle
          and commotion as eailv as eight o'clock.
          Civic and military companies nriived
          faster than they could be assigned to their
          proper piaces.
          At a lew minutes past ten o'clock the
          head of the column began to move down
          Fifth avenue, led by the Fifth United
          States Artlllcrv and .Military Band. Then
          followid the United StatesXaval brigade,
          Uniietl Males Army brigade. Second reg
          iment Now Jersey National Guard and a
          di'tachment of Ma-aciiiisctts volunteer
          militia. These composed the first divi
          sion. The second division was loci by Gil
          niore's famous baud. Then followed the
          Fiist Brigade, X. G. S. N. Y., acting as
          escort to the French column. The
          Fiench column contained ttie Socie'.e
          Colmarienne; Union .Wsacicnuc; Socielc
          Alsiice-I.oiaiue; Marcli Gras Association;
          Societe l)e Philanthropic; Union Chorale

          inaire Cosmopolite; L' Helvetieiiiie; L'
          Alliance and L' Union Fraternellc.
          Then came another line band of music,
          which was followed by nearly a dozen
          moie Fiench societies. Behind the
          Frenchmen came the United Stale
          Judges and other high officials of tin:
          United Slates in carriages, and Governors
          ot Mates and Territoiics and other high
          dignitaries, also in carriages, who brought
          up the rear ot the second division.
          The third division was headed by
          Sheriff Grant as marshal, and was com
          prised of mayors of cities; a battalion
          of Philadelphia police; Brooklyn police:
          veterans ol the war of 1812; veterans of
          the .Mexican war, and the military order
          of the Loyal Legion.
          The fourth, fifth and sixth divisions
          were composed of military organizations.
          Then came the educational division: then
          mote military; Washington's carriage,
          drawn by nine lioies, escorted by the
          Continental Guard of Washington, and
          the old Washington Continental Guard,
          mounted. Firemen, Knights of Pythias
          and other organization's all helped to
          make up the other four divisions.
          As this brilliant column passed down
          Fifth avenue it was received by the enor
          mous crowds, which flanked it ou either
          tide with mighty cheers
          As the procession approached the re
          viewing stand at Madison Square, where
          President Cleveland and members of Ids
          Cab net were in waiting, a slight drizzle
          cf rain bi-gan falling, not enough, how
          ever, to disturb the crowd or spoil the
          spectacle.
          After passing through Martion Square
          the colnmn moved on down Fifth Avenue
          to Washington Square, where it turned
          into Broadway, thence dewu Broadway
          to the open space behind the post-olllce,

          the triumphal arch in front of the M'orM
          otllce, nnd back into Broadway. This de
          tour was more In order to pay a compli
          ment to the enterprise of the World, in
          raising the sum necessary for ralslug
          Bartholdi's great work.
          From Park Bow the route was again
          down Broadway to Courtlandt street and
          Maiden Lane, where most of the mili
          tary, turning to right or left, made their
          way to the river.
          The head of the procession reached the
          City Hall at noon. At the same time,
          whenever the iunIc of the bands ceased,
          the chimes of Trinity Church could be
          heard playing National airs of France
          and America.
          President Cleveland, accompanied by
          Secretary Bayard, drove to the reviewing
          stand at Madison square. He was fol
          lowed by Secretaries Whitney, Vilas and
          Lamar aud Colonel Lamout.
          Alter leaving Broadway at Cortlandt
          street and Maiden Lane, nearly all the
          military and civic companies made their
          way homeward.
          At this hour hoar (1:15 p. m.), the
          procession is still wending its way past
          the United Press office, 187 Broadway,
          having been over an hour in progress.
          All the vessels in North river are gaily
          decorated with flags, tho Great Atlantic
          liners being particularly noticeable as
          they lay at their docks, one mass ot color
          aloft.
          The naval parade, which forms another
          marked feature of the day, was set for
          one o'clock. The sound of the prepa
          tatory gun, which should have been fired
          at 12:45 p. m., was not heard until one
          o'clock, and there was considerable delay
          In getting the vessels which were to take
          part into line. Twenty minutes later the
          signal for the start was given, and tho
          vessels moved slowlv in double line from
          Forty-fifth street down North river, past
          a fleet of war vessels, toward Liberty
          Island. This procession was in charge
          of Lieutenant-Commander liich, and con
          sisted of two divisions. The first division
          was headed by the United Stales coast
          survey steamer Gciluuy, and consisted of
          all the larger vesels. The second divi
          sions consisted of tugs and miscellane
          ous crall of all descriptions. The ves
          sels presented a oeautiful sight as thev
          steamed down the Hudson. On i caching
          Liberty Island, they passed astern of the
          lii-m-ul-war anchored below the island
          then ill) between them and the island, till
          they came to abreast of the statue head
          on tide, where they remained at anchor
          until the end of the cetenionies ac that
          poiut.

          he was cheered, but when Bartholdi, tin;
          sculptor, appeared and was easily rec
          ognized by the mass, who had seen his
          portrait on programmes and in the il
          lustrated papers, a shout went up Irom
          those neatest the stand. The cry of
          "Bartholdi" was then caught np by both
          the reviewing Mid grand stands. The
          crowds on tin: avenue cuibings up and
          down heard the name and passed it to
          the people in the park and side
          sticets until the heavy air wns shaken
          with a i oar of cheering that must have
          gladdened the heart ol the Alsatian, who
          bowed his acknowledgments. Ami then,
          in carriages driven to the rear of the
          stand, came Mr. Cleveland and his party.
          Instantly lie was recognized, and again
          the crowds shook the welkin with their
          shouts, and from the housetops and win
          dows of hotels came shouts and sounds
          of clapping hands to swell Hie sound
          that like a wave broke over the park and
          flowed down tbc streets and along the
          avenue, where, in the misty distance, t lie
          trappings mid pomp of the head of the
          column was seen moving. The Signal
          Service operator at the Twenty-eighth
          Slnet station made known the fact to
          tiic throngs by a waving flag, and the
          pressure Increased toward the avenue
          and the people became packed more
          closely if it were possible.
          On the reviewing
          stand President
          Cleveland was pic
          sented witli three
          handsome baskets of

          A grand stand was

          the surrounding i am

          The closing ceremonies iu the evening
          were a magnificent display of fireworks
          by James Payn, given on Liberty and
          Governor's islands, together with a
          grand illumination of French and Amer
          ican men-of-war. The pyrotechnic dis
          plays were the most wonderful and
          elaborate that have ever been witnessed
          iu this country. The funds for the fire
          works had been generously provided
          through the patriotic efforts of Mr.

          money for a fitting display of fireworks
          on the ocexsion of the unveiling of the
          great statue led Mr. Clews and the other
          gentlemen named to agree to furnish the
          uecessary money provided the displavs be
          given by James Pain, of Manhattan Bench,
          under the direction of the New York
          IPorid. When Mr. Pain was spoken to
          in regard to the matter he generously of
          fered to double whatever sum was raised
          by the patriotic friends of the statue and
          give a programme that would folly real
          ize their expectations. The ground had
          been gone over by an agent of Mr. Pain,
          nnd no trouble or expense was spared to
          make the displays the grandest
          ever witnessed In this country. The vast
          materials for the fireworks had been spe
          cially prepared for this occasion by Mr.
          Pain, and several new effects In pyro
          technics were introduced. The displays
          were begun with the lighting of the great
          torch for the first tinicl and were given
          simultaneoualy on Liberty and Govern
          or's islands, including some sixty sepa
          rate pyrotechnic pieces. With slight va
          riations the fireworks were the same on
          Liberty island and in front of old Castle
          William, on Governor's Island, and
          were set off by maroon signals from the
          statue. The displays were largely
          aerial and were vis
          ible from all parts of
          the harbor, although
          the best positions
          were the Battery and
          Brooklyn Bridge, or
          from the decksof ex
          cursion steamers
          midway between the
          two islands. The war
          ships weie anchored

          The yards and rigging were manned
          by sailors, and the marines were drawn
          up on the decks along the bulwarks.
          Brilliant calcium lights burned irom the
          extremities of the yards and fore and aft
          on deck, while the men stationed in the
          riggingand along the decks were supplied
          with colored lire. The displays ou the

          The famous statue, by Bartholdi, of
          "Liberty Enlightening the World" was
          received at New York, June 211, 1885.
          The Fiencli vessel Isere, wttli the statue
          on board, was escorted up the b-iy to
          Bcdloe's Island by a number of United
          States men-of-war and other vessels. The
          statue stands on Bcdloe's Island here
          after to be known as Liberty Island. At
          tlie entrance to New York haibor,
          Bartholdi, it is said, conceived the idea
          of rearing a colossal statue to symbolize
          America's message of liberty to the world
          whiie sailing up Aew lork bay on his
          vi-it to this country in 1871, with heart
          depressed at the itiin and wretchedness
          in his native land after her defeat bv Ger
          many. On his return to France he sug
          gested to his friends his idea of such
          a statue to be presented by the
          French nation to the United States.
          The idea was received with great favor,
          and so rapidly did subscriptions come
          iu that in 187(1 the sculptor began work
          upon his great statue. M. Bartholdi
          supervised every step of the work
          which was not only a
          labor of many years,
          but one lull of di!li
          culty and detail The
          first "steps toward its
          construction were
          made iu 1874, when
          the French-American
          union was establish
          ed, a banquet given
          and an appeal made to
          the people of France.
          In 1870 the sculptor
          began actual work.
          First the artist made
          his model in clay,
          and when this was
          approved a plaster
          statue was made; in
          dimensions it was
          one-sixteenth thesize
          THE TORCH.
          of the intended statue. Another plaster
          statue four times as large as the first, and
          a third one, of the full dimensions ol the
          finished work were made. The last
          modci hnd to be made iu sections, and a
          wooden frame-work was constructed on
          which the plaster was spread. When
          these sections were completed, wooden
          models were used, exact copies of the
          plaster In size and modeling. These
          were carcfnlly cut out by hand, and in
          them were shaped the hammered brass
          work which forms the outside of the
          statue. Eighty-eight tons of brass were
          used in the structure, and the entire
          weight of the statue is 450,000 pounds.
          In 187G M. Bartholdi, with the extended
          right arm of the statue the first part
          that was completed came to America
          and placed the arm and torch iu
          the Centennial Exhioition at Phila
          delphia, whence it was subscqnently
          removed to Madison Square, New
          York. In February, 1877, Congress set
          apart Liberty Island lor the statue,
          and a committee was chosen with
          William M. Evarts at its head. The
          face and head of the statue was com
          pleted in 1878, when it was placed in the
          FrcuchExposition.andouJuly 7, 1880, the
          great figure was com
          pleted in Paris, where
          it was temporarily
          put together the fol
          lowing year in the
          presence of the Unit
          ed States Minister
          and a gathering of
          prominent French
          people. This statue
          is a free gift of re
          spect and good will

          France to those of

          was intense, and bets were freely made
          on the three men then in the lead, Mul
          ford being the favorite up to the begin
          ning of the last lap The drivers were
          hltUng up a speed estimated at" more
          than eighty miles an hour, and averaging
          on the whole a speed of close to seventy
          Ave miles an hour, which Included the
          stops Ray Harroun. Ralph Mulford.
          Bruce Brown, and Joe Dawson, in a Mar

          race, about one lap separating the four
          drivers
          Harroun was in the lead at 450 miles,

          them with such terrific -fcrce that both
          16 and 35 were dragged along to the road
          way opposite the gate. The impact
          caused No. 7 to turn over, throwing
          Knight and his mechanician some dis
          tance. The accidents occurred within a few
          feet of a crowd of people, who were
          panic-stricken at the danger and rushed
          for places of safety. Many of the peo
          ple were so filled with terror that they
          cried from excitement and several hun

        <text>The eyes of the motoring public
          were focuped last week on the
          Indianapolis speedway, where
          records galore were establish
          ed and for the first time in
          the history of the automobile a *00-mile
          race was successfully run ofT and an
          American, in an American-built
          proved the victor in the great interna
          tional sweepstakes race. Although
          race was not without its death toll-one
          being killed and seven injured still
          fact that more were not kille seeme
          wonderful- Even the one death recorde
          might have been avoided had a few
          seconds been taken to securely fasten a
          loose rim. As it was the rim flew oft
          and as a result a mechanician on one of
          the cars was killed. The driver of the
          car admitted after the race that the rim
          was loose when his car was called to
          the starting line and there was "no time
          to tighten it." Besides betting on favor
          ites in the big race promoters even, went
          so far as to wager on the number of
          those participating in the event who,
          would meet with death in the long grind.
          The winning car-a "Marmon Wasp,
          piloted by young Ray Harroun, traveled
          the SOO miles at an average speed of 74..7,
          miles an hour. It Is a world s record
          for sustained automobile travel. The,
          only performance with which It can be j
          compared Is the twenty-four-hour world's
          record made by S. F. Edge on the famous I
          cement track at Brooklands. England. In j
          that event he covered 4i4 miles in trie
          first seven hours, as against Harroun t j
          {Km miles in nineteen minutes less. The
          race took place on Decoration day and
          was attended by nearly 8.1,000 persons.
          The number of cars starMng in the event
          was forty, the largest field ever witnessed
          on a track or speedway In America.

          On the day prior to the 500-mlle race
          "Wild Bob" Burman. in his powerful JTO
          horsepower Blitzen Benz. set up new fig
          ures on the Indianapolis speedway for
          the Quarter, half and mile distances,
          a new mark for the kilometer as well.
          While Burman was cleaning things up in
          his own masterly fashion. Barney Old
          fiHd. who held the title of "speed king
          prior to "Bob" entering the field, sat
          quietly in the grandstand and watched
          the records go by the boards. Burman
          used the same car which Oldfield used
          when he established the records which

          were broken last week. The mile record
          was lowered from 35.63 to 35.3B. The new
          quarter-mile record Is 8.16. and for the
          half-mile. 16.83 seconds. The kilometer
          now stands at 21.40, as against 21.46
          made by Oldfield. Burman Is now enti
          tled to the honor of "speed king." which
          honor came to him a few weeks ago at
          Daytona Beach. Fla.

          A word or two about the new record
          holders at this time would not be out of
          place. in view of the wonderful feats
          which they have performed behind the
          throttle.
          Robert Burman, acknowledged "speed
          king." is but twenty-seven years old.
          Bom near Imlay City. iMich., In 1S84, Bur
          man lived on the farm until about ??v
          enteen years of age. Then he went to
          testing automobiles, and tested the first
          car ever made by the Buick Motor Com
          pany, when the factory was located at
          Jackson. Mich. iAter he entered the em
          ploy of the Jackson Automobile Company,
          and soon became head tester. While he
          was thus employed a freak racing car
          was built in Jackson, and the builder In
          vited Burman to a five-mile match race
          on the mile horse track at the fair
          grounds. Burman took the chance of be
          ing shown up. and won the race by al
          most a mile.
          This started the speed career of the pres
          ent monarch of them all After much per
          suasion and the ofTer to pay hit own ex
          penses if the company would let htm have
          a car he was allowed to enter a tifty-mile
          race at Detroit in 11)06. All of the big
          bovs of the game were in, but Bob start
          ed out to "beat it." and won the race
          hands down. His next experience was to
          drive twenty-two and a half hours of a
          twenty-four-hour race In St. Louis the
          same year and win by eiKhty-two miles.
          Then the Buick company got him and
          his career which gained him the name of
          "Wild Bob" started. He was but twenty
          three years old, but he proved hi? ability
          and his nerve, and hip promotion was
          fast. A list of Burman's winnings would
          fill a fair-sized volume. His most notable
          victory of 1910 was first American car
          in the Savannah grand prize race and
          third in the race. He won several long
          races at the Indianapolis motor speed
          way in July, 1010, but the disqualification
          of the Marquette-Buick cars loscredits he gained by clever driving.
          Burman left the Buick team early this
          year to drive the cars formerly owned by
          Barney Oldfield. He immediately drove
          the Ji*>-horsepower Blitzen Benz faster
          than Oldfield ever had dared, thereby
          breaking all records for the kilometer,
          mile and two-mile distances. The rec
          ords made by Burman in the Benz at
          Daytona April 1011, were: Kilometer,
          15.88: mile. 25.40. and two miles, ftl.28.
          This is faster than man ever traveled be
          fore.

          Ray Harroun was born at Spartans
          burg. Pa., and is twenty-nine years old.
          He has driven in practically all of the
          great automobile races during the last
          three or four years. He holds a long list
          of records and has won many trophies.
          Harroun won more firsts than any other
          driver during 1010. Following are some of
          his records, regardless of class: 35 miles.

          Preparations are rapidly bef"* pushed
          to completion for the Glidden tour, which
          starts from this city Jun? and >nidh at
          Ottawa, Canada, June a dlstan :e of
          l.*f>7 miles, over r-jads of every descrip

          in order that tho?e pvticlpatlnjr in ti.?e

          It will be one of the most picturesque
          tours ever held.
          Perhaps a number of manufacturers
          and o* tiers in the industry do rot fully
          realize what tiie Canadian reciprocity
          agreement means. It is of far greater
          importance t'> the automobile industry
          than t'le avertge man imagines. The
          reduction of duty on American-made
          cars from 3."? to :;o per cent opens up a
          wider channel for American goods to
          flow across the border, and brings a rich
          market for cars closer to our door.
          According to turer, Canada, within the next few years,
          will be buying loads of cars of the
          utility type for use in its vast grain re
          gion. When one stops to think that in
          the United States more than 80,000
          farmers use automobiles, and that hair'
          of these are grain producers, who find
          noicr tars economical in their business,
          it is not difficult to foresee that Canada,
          with its enormous- grain industry, the
          vastne^s of wpich scarcely can l>e con
          ceived. shorti.* will follow suit and adopt
          the motor car en a much greater scale.</text>

          and driving the speed creation or
          the most brilliant engineering minds
          of Europe and America, the drivers
          entered in the second annual' 500
          mile race at the Indianapolis motor
          speedway will begin their long jour
          ey around the brick oval at 10
          o'clock next Thursday morning.
          For the second time In the history
          ot (the world's greatest race course
          the five-century contest for cars un
          dep 600 cubic Inches will be offered
          to the speed lovers and the sporting
          Inclined followers of the automobile
          game In the United States.
          This is the greatest of. track 'races.
          The first 500 mile event on Ithe vitri
          fied oval at Indianapolis astonished
          the world, and Ray Harroun In nis
          Marmon Wasp was the hero of the
          nearly seven-hour speed combat. The
          first race taught the speedway man
          agement, the engineers, the drivers
          and last but not least, the public.
          The second race will astonish the
          world. The greatest drivers on this
          side of the Atlantic are entered and
          many of them participated In the
          first event. The cars are faster than
          In 1911. The requirements of the en
          try conditions were much more strin--genlt
          The facilities for handling the
          largest number of people that will
          witness a sporting event in 1912 are
          much improved over the 1911 condi
          tions and Indianapolis people by co
          operating with the speedway man
          agement and the hotels will be able
          to easily handle all Its guests.
          The motor speedway, at a cost of
          $650,000, has substituted a tunnel for
          the old foot bridge just north of the
          pits. This will facilitate the hand
          ling of the autos that are parked In
          the infield and the vast crowds that
          will view the race from this enclos-
          lirp. Thfl Ifnnnpl lu Inaf r.t-K rt f ia

          and also provides two passages for
          pedestrians elevated above the ve
          hicle passages.
          The pits at the south end where
          Harry Knight pushed his Westcott
          into the wall to escape crushing the
          Case mechanician, Anderson, last
          year, have been fitted with concrete
          walls like the other' pits in place of
          the former wooden partitions.
          The speedway has in every way
          perfected its arrangements to make
          safe every possible angle of the, race.
          The track has been gone over care
          fully and smoothed 'out. The driv
          ers were instructed Monday night
          at 8 o'clock, in a meeting at J:he Clay
          pool hotel by the A. A. A. officials in
          charge of the race, and cautioned to
          be vigilant at "all times. An elaborate
          signal system for use in emergencies
          on the track has been worked out.

          details prove to the layman that the
          first race demonstrated to the speed
          way and the motor car designers and
          builders the necessity of the precau
          tions in running, a race of such a dis
          tance. Not only will the race for 500 miles
          be the longest track,, event in 1912,
          but it will also offer the largest
          amount of cash to the drivers of the

          MATIONAL'S RACE
          P* IS POPULAR HERE
          By LEON J. PINKSON
          THE National's decisive victory in
          the Indianapolis speedway raoo
          yesterday was received with much!
          joy in local motoring circles. To be j
          sure, much sympathy was expressed fc
          De Palma. who lost the $10,000 puree
          when victory seemed certain, but the j
          fact that an American built car came j
          in the victor and set a new world's j
          record overshadowed the misfortune of i
          De Palma and his Mercedes and aroused I
          THE SAN FRANCIJStJO^OAI^L/ FiiIDAY, MaY 31, 1912.
          the truly patriotic enthusiasm that
          goes with Amerlpan success.
          Interest in the race was at a hlfb
          pitch throughout the six hours it was
          being run, and the bulletins that drifted
          from the race course telling of the
          shifting of places among the fast mov
          ing cars were devoured with keen
          eagerness. Most of the principal cars
          in the big race are represented here
          and the headquarters for the respect
          ive machines were the centers for
          emwds of zealots who gathered to learn
          of the progress of the race.
          That a new world's record was set
          was not a surprise, for it was gen
          erally conceded that the entries this
          year were the faatest cars that were
          ever matched. The victory of tRe Na
          tional car was also no particular sur
          prise, for the car was frequently men
          tioned as one of the most probable
          winners, judging from the fast time the
          entries were making in the tryouts.
          At the headquarters of the Howard
          Automobile company, distributer* for
          the National, the news of the victory
          was received with wild delight. Gep

          eral Manager Tt. K. Roberts of the
          company was most joyous over the suc
          cess of the car because of the fact that
          he had freely predicted a National vic
          tory, and Dawson's car was .the very
          one in which he made several circuits
          of the speedway track during his recent
          visit in Indianapolis. On this'oocasion
          he was the guest of Herr, Dawson's re
          lief driver, who shares in tlte winning
          laurels.
          "Setting the world's record at an
          average of 78.7 miles per hour with a
          regulation stock car means something,"
          eaid Roberts yesterday, "especially as
          the car maintained that speed for six
          consecutive hours. It not pnly shows
          the strength and power of the motor,
          but the remarkable construction of the
          car, which at no time was forced to
          stop at the pit for mechanical adjust
          ments of any sort."

          another of the joyous members of the

          third, covering the 500 miles in 6:34.56,
          an average of 78.07 miles an hour. The
          Mercer has never failed to come in the

          Racing is but part of the manufacturing
          process that tests and perfects National cars for
          your safety, comfort and indefatigable service.
          A race such as the 500-milc event, won by the
          National from a field of cars from all nations,
          most of which arc higher priccd than the Na
          tional, is a much harder test of every ounce of
          power and every fiber of strength than a tour of
          thousands of miles.
          That the National again proved its superi
          ority is your unimpeachable guide to the best car.

          September 15.

          A 1912 flvp-passenger Paige taurine car
          was delivered last week to G. O. Wilson.
          The car is finished in dark blue, with gray
          running gear, and Is" fully equipped.

          To build, for the especial use of an
          automobile tour, a stretch of road over
          seventy miles in length, traversing a
          country that has heretofore been acces
          sible only to pack animals, is the unique
          feat of a body of public-spirited residents
          of northern Arizona.
          The new road connects the railroad of
          Ash Fork with the government reserva
          tion at Grand Canyon. The tour for
          which it was constructed Is the first of
          Its kind, including, as it does, an aggre
          gation of over sixty Studebaker cars,
          nearly all of which are owned in Phoenix,
          the Arizona metrppolis.
          When the tour was first announced it
          was the intent of the Phoenix men to
          drive their cars to the canyon by a rough
          roundabout route, following the lines of
          the Santa Fe railroad by way of Wil
          liams. Hut the citizens of Ash Fork ob
          jected. They readily appreciated the fact
          that their own town was missing a fine
          chance to show itself to advantage on
          the map. A committee accordingly told
          the Phoenix people that they would guar
          antee a more direct route via Ash Fork.
          Then they went to work with their picks
          and shovels, working out half-way, where
          they met a similarly public-spirited pang
          of road builders from Grand Canyon, who
          had laid out the second half of the trail.
          The whole Job was under the direction of
          the veteran "BH1" Bass, who has lived
          in the Grand Canyon country since be
          fore the days of the railroad, and lie
          has been locally credited on many occa
          sions with having dug the himself. This feat Mr. Bass modestly
          denies.
          The Studebaker Flanders "20." path
          finder tor the tour, recently made the
          trip to the canyon over the new road.
          Though the car carried tive men and
          their baggage, the run was easily made
          at an average speed of nearly twenty
          miles an hour.
          The entire distance over the new
          road longed slightly more than seven
          ty-three miles. About half was typical
          desert country, inhabited by prairie
          dog-s. coyotes, a few antelope and an
          immense herd of wild horses. The
          other half is similarly arid, but rather
          mountainous. For more than twenty
          five miles the road follows a tortuous
          valley. There is no human habita
          tion between Ash Fork and Grand
          Canyon, and not a single well or stream
          of water, except in the rainy season,
          now several months past.</text>

          Starter Root ordered all of the cars
          on the track at 9 o'clock to test out
          the emergency brakes.
          While going at high speed In the
          home stretch, the signal for the emer
          gency brakes was given and each car
          had to stop within a short distance.
          Other officials were busy at the pits
          checking up the driver, mechanicians
          and pit helpers as only a limited num
          ber were allowed in each pit.
          Race Starts.
          Promptly at 10 o'clock te 27 cars,
          led by Carl G. Fisher, millionaire
          sportsman, began the long race
          around the two and a half mile track,
          amid the cheers of thousands and
          the waving of flags of five nations.
          The cars got away with a flying start
          and were going 50 miles an hour as
          they came down the. long home
          stretch.
          Jenkins' Schact was the first car to
          stop at the pits. The machine blew
          a right rear tire. He lost a lap by
          the stop.
          Before Jenkins started again, An
          derson's Stutz drew up at the pits
          with the same trouble.
          Ralph De Palma, in a Mercer,
          dropped out of the race on the eigh
          teenth lap, on account of cylinder
          trouble. He was soon followed by
          Jenkins' Schacht, which broke a crank
          case in the twentieth lap.
          Kerr's Stutz broke a clutch re
          lease in the back stretch and caught
          fire. He was out of the race. No
          one was injured.
          The boiling hot sun caused consid
          erable tire trouble and one car after
          another dropped in at the pits for a
          change.

          Speedway, Indianapolis, May 30.
          Burman, in a Keeton,, leading for the
          first 100 miles, broke all speedway
          records for that distance. His time
          aws 1:15:50.55. The former record
          was 1:23:43.11.
          Goux, in the French Peugeot, was
          second. Twenty-three cars were still
          running at this distance.

          Zuearrelll's Peugeot, a French car,
          went out of race with burned out bear

          This was not done for reckless bra

          definite purpose of checking the panic.
          In this they failed, but they set an

          Indianapolis, Ind. Jules Goux, driv
          ing a Peugot car, over which waved
          tho flag of France, won the 500

          time was G hours, 31 minutes, 43.15
          seconds, an average of 76.59 miles an
          hour. His rewards were internation
          al honors, cash prizes worth $35,000,
          including the $20,000 cash prize of
          fered by the management of tho

          Wlshart Second In Contest.
          Spencer Wlshart, who drove a Mer
          cer car into second place at the finish
          of the race, was given a kissless and
          champagneles8 reception at the Mer
          cer pits, but his two hands, worn out
          by the steady work at the wheel of
          his car, were shaken wildly by a hun
          dred admirers. He was lifted upon
          the shoulders of his pit men and
          cheered with the enthusiasm equal to
          that accorded to the Frenchman. He
          was given a check for ?10,000.
          One of the most remarkable bits of
          race car driving was staged by
          Charles Merz In his Stutz car when
          he drove three and one-half miles,
          more than one lap around the course,
          with his car ablaze beneath the en
          gine and his mechanician and himself
          hardly able to keep their seats on ac
          count of the flames that were licking
          at their legs. Merz was watched on
          his lap by the breathless thousands
          who feared his car would explode or
          that he would be driven from tho
          wheel by the ilameB. Displaying al
          most unbelievable nerve, he waved
          acknowledgement of the green flag,
          flashed over him by Starter Root as
          ho crossed the finish line for tho next
          to the last time and settled Into the
          hot seat of his car for tho final lap.
          Races With Car Ablaze.
          Spectators remaining in the grand
          stands and bleachers were on their
          feet straining for a glimpse of tho
          intrepid young Indianapolis driver as
          rounded the last curve and started
          down tho final Etrotch with tongues
          of flames spurting from under tho
          hood of his car. He could not havo
          mado another lap. His car would
          have gone to pieces in another mile.
          But it remained intact and continued
          to do his bidding until It limped
          across tho finish lino and Merz was
          $5,000 wealthier. Pit men had ex
          tinguishers ready and extinguished
          tho fire that soon would havo de
          Btroyed tho car. Charles Merz's fath
          er is an Indianapolis policeman with
          a record for bravery to his credit.

          beam, drovo a consistent race to
          fourth place and a prize of $3,500. Ho
          was more of a favorite with tho
          crowd than Goux becnuso of numer
          ous brushes lie had with other cars
          In front of the main grandstand,
          where ho showed a wonderful control
          of his mount and left a trail of smoke

          RJCFTKISyi
          W'HAT becomes of all the old
          automobiles?
          This is a question that has
          often been asked but seldom answered.
          Each year thousands of automobiles
          are manufactured and sold and thou
          sands are discarded to the scrapheap.
          Like all pieces of expensive machinery,
          the automobile winds up its career of
          usefulness by being sold for old Junk.
          Tho engines are often sold to second
          hand dealers, who utilize them for
          many different purposes.
          Many of tbe automobiles purchased
          years ago by El Pasoans-have long
          since found themselves in the discard,
          while others have burned, up. Perhaps
          the oldest car In point of service now
          owned In El Paso is a Rambler, pur
          chased in 1904 by Charles Rader. This
          car has traveled more than 100.000
          miles and Is today being used by Mr.
          Rader. The car is now nearly 15 years

          Protect the Family
          In Bad Weather
          Everybody knows the Hupmobile has long been
          the car of the American family.
          Now it is the winter car of the American
          family, because the Sedan top gives the family com
          plete protection, says the Lone Star Motor Co., the
          local Hupmobile dealer.
          I'd like you to see the car with the top fitted, be
          cause I'm pretty sure you will want one for your own
          family.
          The extra cost is so small that it is out of all
          proportion to the comfort afforded and the colds and
          doctor bills it prevents. N
          Its appearance is handsome it harmonizes per
          fectly with the 1915 Hup's beautiful lines it is sub
          stantially built and firmly, though temporarily,
          attached.
          Inside it compares with the richest limousine.
          And when spring comes, take it off and store
          it away.
          If you care for your family's comfort and your
          own, better see the new car.

          Reo, which he purchased In 1907 and
          which has run approximately 75,000
          miles and is still In, use. This car has
          probably traveled further than any lit
          tle car ever owned In the southwest. It
          is still being used by Mr. Woodworth
          to drive daily to and from the office.
          Kl Paso's First Anto.
          The first automobile ever brought to
          El Paso was owned by the late Frank
          Bell, who brought it here in 1901. He
          purchased the car from the Locomobile
          factory and it was a great curiosity to
          the residents of El Paso. Every time
          Mr. Bell appeared on the streets with
          the machine a large crowd would
          gather to inspect the new form of lo
          comotion. The automobile was only in
          Its infancy when Mr. Bell purchased the
          car and he did not find it much of a
          pleasure conveyance. As a rule the ma
          chine was seldom taken from the
          garage without balking a short dis
          tance down the street The machine
          burned up in a fire about a year after
          Mr. Bell purchased it.
          The First Electric.
          The first electric automobile ever
          brought to El Paso was purchased by
          Felix Martinez. He states that he pur
          chased the car about 1899 to be used as
          a delivery car for the Daily News, since
          absorbed by The El Paso Herald. But,
          like the Locomobile owned by Mr. Bell,
          the electric was anything but a success
          as an automobile. Mr. Martinez, in
          speaking of the car recently, laughing,
          said that the machine only moved Tlen
          someone had his shoulder against it
          and seldom moied on its own locomo
          tion. After several experiments with
          the machine, he abandoned it, and
          finally gave it to some boys who soon
          destroyed it The electric cost Mr.
          Martinez $2700
          Roads Too Rough.
          J. A. Smith purchased one of the first
          gasoline automobiles in the city. It
          was a failure, principally because of
          the rough roads and streets at that
          time, and he finally sold it to a Mexi
          can and the car has long since been in
          the scrap heap.
          The car was a Cadillac and the ton

          There were many other automobiles
          purchased from that time until 1907,
          but there were few of the cars that
          were successes. In 1907 the state
          paBsed the automobile license law and
          all motorists In the county owning ma
          chines had to havo them registered.
          This is the first record obtainable of El
          Paso automobiles.
          The first automobile license Issued
          in 1907 by Park Pitman, county clerk,
          was taken out by Dr. Frank Thatcher.
          He secured the license on August 1, for
          a Holsman automobile, a small runa

          took out the third automobile .license.
          This was his second car, however. His
          first one he purchased In 1902, when he
          gave up his position at the throttle of
          a locomotive and put the first public
          car into service in El Paso. Mr. Davis
          has been driving a public machine since
          that time. His first car was a Cadillac;
          his second an Oldsmoblle.
          The fourth automobile license Issued
          by the county clerk was taken out by
          W. B Latta for a Reo touring car. Mr.
          Latta states that he sold the machine
          a lear later, but docs not remember to

          entry blanks having been sent out to
          manufacturers of cars and private
          owners here and abroad. Despite the
          war. It is thought the contest will be
          most successful, plenty of material
          being available on both sides of the
          Atlantic Italy alone is expected to
          furnish no less than six machines.
          Changes in the specifications for the
          Indianapolis contest are numerous, the
          chief of these being the reduction of
          motor dimensions bv one-third, or from
          450 to 300 cubic inches, and the raising
          of the speed minimum to 80 miles.
          With much smaller machines better
          results are demanded. This Is the
          chief utilitarian function of the racing
          game.
          The number of starters has been
          raised to 23, as compared with 30 of
          ears previous. This Is the full ca
          pacity alloted the track under the rul
          ings of the American Automobile as
          sociation, which specify a limit of one
          car to everj 400 feet of track.
          Speed trials to determine the final
          field will be held 10 days ahead of
          the race, In the inverse order of en
          try, the fastest 33 being eligible. In
          the event of more than three cars of
          one "make entering, the fastest three
          will be admitted. This Is to eliminate
          the speedway from wrangles between
          factories and private owners desiring
          to enter cars of the same make In ex
          cess of the A. A. maximum.
          Cars will line up for the start In the
          order of the time made in the speed
          trials, the fastest car starting in first
          position, next the pole. Racing num
          bers will be issued on the same plan,
          the fastest car receiving No. 1. This
          is to avoid the possibility of a spill
          during the flying start, when a slow
          machine in front would be in the why.
          The color of cars will be according
          to international usage, i. e, Germany,
          white; Belgium, yellow; France, blue;
          Italy, red, and America, red and white.
          In previous years Individual combina
          tions have been employed, at times to
          the great amusement of the spectators.
          Regulations as to the physical con
          dition of drivers and the mechanical
          soundness of cars will be more rigid
          ly enforced next year than ever be
          fore The front axles of all machines
          must thus be entirely new two days
          before the race This is to guard
          against possibility of accident, due to
          crystallization or other defect Any
          car spilling an excess of oil on the
          track, will, for like reasons, be dis
          qualified. The Dawson-Gilhooley accident of
          last year has caused chain-driven cars
          to be barred from the track, Unless
          the chains are adequately though not
          necessarily fully enclosed. Gllhooley,
          it will be remembered, came to grief
          because a bursted tire caught between
          his chain and gears, rendering his car
          beyond control, due to the action of
          his differential. This accident was not
          as has so often been stated, traceable
          to incompetence on Gilhooley's part
          Prizes remain substantially ths
          same, $60,000 being split 10 ways
          among the winners, with $20,000 first
          money.- The intermediate trophies,
          however, including the G. J. trophy,
          the Remy trophy and brassard, the
          Prest-O-Lite trophy, and the AVheeler
          Schebler cup, will not be withRVld If
          their winner falls to go the entire dis
          tance of 500 miles, as formerly, but it
          will be awarded regardless of their
          owner's status at the finish. This, It
          is thought, will speed up the race a
          great deal.</text>

        <text>NEARLY KILLED MANY TIMES OVER, AUTO
          RACERS WILL AGAIN DEFY DEATH MONDAY
          Once an auto racer, always in
          auto racer. There is something
          In that game of whizz and thrill
          that causes meu to forget; to
          Ignore all past injuries; and to
          risk, their lives again and again.
          When the big squad of the
          fastest drivers ln the world gets
          the word to go Monday at Indian
          apolis at least 20 men who have
          escaped death narrowly, who
          have been broken and torn, who
          have been hurled through the Ur,
          who have fried under burning,
          overturned wreckage of great
          racing machines, will shoot away
          from the mark.
          In the van will be Joe Dawson
          who, a year ago on that same
          track was hurled through the
          barriers, burned under the wreck
          age of his burning car and
          dragged out cut and torn beyond
          recognition.
          They are strange beings, these
          fellows who risk limb and m-yi
          for money and sport.
          Ralph De Palma, now premier
          driver of the world, has been
          known at once as the luckiest
          and unluckiest driver. His worst
          accident wan the crash at Mil
          waukee in 1912, when near the
          finish he had a mixup with Caleb
          Bragg that spoiled one of the
          greatest finishes of auto racing.
          Bragg is a man worth perhaps
          $5,000,000 who races for the
          thrills. He is ln this race.
          Even recent accidents seem to
          have little effect. Tom Alley
          went through a fence; Ed O'Don
          nell crashed into the fence and
          was turned over; Ed Pullen, who
          was badly hurt a year ago, mixed
          In another accident ln the Van
          derbilt this year aud escaped with
          slight injuries—and all are back
          to risk more of the same as smil
          ing and fearless as If nothing
          ever went wrong.
          John De Palatna has had a
          dozen bad spills, even though
          this is his first really big race.
          He is a brother qL the faniojs
          Ralph and the majority of his ac
          cidents have happened on the
          small "bush" tracks.
          Dario Resta, the wild man, had
          a terrible accident at Brook fields.
          was in a had smashup at Berlin
          and a worse one at Rome, but
          drives as if he never knew a car
          could turn ovtrr.
          Bob f_iir.ii.-iti has faced death
          many times. Perhaps his narrow
          est escape was in 1912 when "its
          car blew out both roar tires at
          the same instant. The machine
          was hurled into the air, turned
          three somersaults, and alighted a
          smoking mass of twisted steel—•
          with Burnian underneath and .ie
          crawled out without dangerous
          Injuries.
          Yes, they are all back. So lo.igl
          as they have a leg or an arm
          they'll be there.

        <text>Babe Ruth Is Lucky to Get Off So Easily After Hittimj Umpire
          FAR be It from ua to wish any guy haid luck, but It appears that Babo Ruth
          escftpefl too easily after his fight with Umplro Owens on tho ball field. Ban
          Johnson dismissed the matter with a flno of $100 nnd a suspension of ono week.
          This does not seem enough, nnd It Is certain that a player of less lmportanro
          would have been treated rather harshly. Ruth is one of tho stars of tho lcaguo .
          and a prolonged nbsenco would havo ruined Boston's pennant chances. Also tho
          gate receipts would have suffered. So Bnttllns Ban beenme as meek ns a lamb
          and decided to "give the boy another chance."
          The bad feature of this case Is that It will cnconrago others to pull tho same
          Btuff. A week's layoff nnd $100 fine Is nice, gentle punishment, nnd tho chances
          are that some playora would pay twice as much for a shot at nn umpire's Jaw.
          It cost McGraw $500 for punching Byron under tho grnnd stand nnd Ruth'a of
          fense was more flagrant thnn that. Ban seems to havo mado another mistake.

          layoff and a healthy tine.
          The dope has run to form at Pittsburgh. Barney Dreyfuss showed Jimmy
          Callahan the way to the gate nnd ho departed from tho city of smoke amid the
          crash and clatter of tho tlnwnro which was dragging behind. Callahan barf not
          made good with the Pirates nnd last year thero was talk of canning him. Ho
          is not popular with the players nnd they wouldn't work for him. Thls also was
          the case when Jimmy was boss of the Whlto Sox. His ability was great, but his
          personality negative.</text>

        <text>Ruth Pitches Red Sox to 1 to O Victory in First World Series Game
          Facts and Fancies
          ^^_By LOUIS LEE ARMS-_
          "Stuffy" Busted In .
          EARL HAMILTON, the left-hander who won six consecutive
          pames for the Pittsburgh Pirates this spring, and then en?
          listed in the United States Navy, used to Bay of "Stuffy"
          Mclnnis, then first baseman of the Philadelphia Athletics:
          "If a left-hander should place a baseball in a burglar-proof box
          and try to sneak it across the plate in the middle of the night he'd
          find 'Stuffy* Mclnnis there waiting to hit. There's one bird who lives
          in luxury off left-handers. He can hit anything they pitch."
          We observe that "Stuffy" broke it up yesterday.
          Vaughn passed Shean, Whiteman blew himself to a single and
          then Mclnnis. catching one of "Hippo" Vaughn's southpaw shoots,
          firmly laced it to left field for the single that scored Shean and gave
          the Red Sox the first game.
          It appears that this Beries is going to run to form.
          Victory Was Merited
          'fHE Cubs should have won, you say, but shoul dthey? In the first,
          1 third, and sixth innings they had men In scoring positions. A single
          would have scored two runs and beat the Sox in two of these innings;
          in the other the score would have been tied. But Pick, Paskert and
          Deal couldn't deliver the essential wallop when the time came. Base?
          ball is, more than anything else, a matter of doing the right thing at
          the right time. Mclnnis did that Pick, Paskert and Deal didn't.
          Ruth in the supreme test surpassed Vaughn, even though the pitching
          figures would indicate that Vaughn had the better of an exceedingly
          interesting duel. The assertion that Chicago should have won merits
          specific qualification.
          Ruth Is Boston's Ace
          THE Red Sox, always a "money team," are legitimately jubilant.
          At worst they will come back to Boston with one victory and two
          defeats. More of such excellent pitching and they will do better.
          Should they win two games and lose but one in Chicago they will be
          the long enders in whatever betting is done after the third game.
          But the jig isn't up with Chicago. Far from it. Vaughn meas?
          ured up to expectations and proved that the Sox do not relish first
          class southpaw pitching. Mitchell has Tyler in reserve and he can
          shoot Vaughn back in the third game if necessary. It remains to be
          seen if Bush or Mays, right-handers, can do as well against the. Cubs
          as Ruth did. Ruth is a great personality on a ball field. A giant in
          stature, resolute of purpose and with a wonderful "single-track"
          brain, re represents almost the ideal athlete for competitive effort
          under groat -Tain. Bush and Mays are not Ruth's equals in tem?
          perament. ,
          Fielding Rather a Surprise I
          THE fielding was a surprise. There were no errors, but neither
          were there hard chances. Chicago hit the ball into the air in the
          pinches and it is a bit early for any one to pull a Snodgrass. The
          Cubs' steck might have soared had the ball been hit on the ground
          and at one of Boston's "green" infielders. Likewise the Cubs ac?
          quitted themselves with honor in the field, but few of their plays,
          too, were made under strain.
          It is an old superstition that the team which wins the first game
          takes the series in this play. But it doesn't follow that there can't
          be exceptions to what has iUogically come to be regarded as a rule.
          The Sox met the rest best yesterday, but more of the Vaughn type
          of pitching and the Curs cannot fail to come through.

          s the first man up. Somehow every
          rr.c seemed to feel that the critical mo

          coaching at first, marked encouragement
          'n tne hatter, but Mitchell watched In

          Bailer swung with all his strength at
          third hall pitched. It flew a great
          Teak on a line for right field. White

        <text>LOOKING EM OVER
          BY
          LOUIS A. DOUGHER
          Georsre Herman Ruth, better known as Battering Babe Ruth, prin
          ipai slugger in major league baseball these day?, has recently given
          ha world an insight into his peculiar brain procesa?if you will admit
          e possesses a brain. Incidentally, hie speech shows him to be quite in
          ccord with many others who think little of their plighted faith. Though
          ;? has two more years to complet? his contract ?with the Boston Red
          ex at a salary of $10,000 yearly. Ruth would sign a new one calling
          ?7T $20,000 yearly. Furthermore, he says he will not play with the Boe
          ra club unless his wishes are granted.
          . Last spring Ruth held out until the last minute. He wanted a
          alary of $15,000, if our memory be correct, but finally compromised by
          ?ft?ing a three-year-contract calling for a salary of $10,000 yearly. All
          oat took place before he began hammering home runs until he had
          Token ail previous big league records for this stunt. He admitted that
          e was satisfied with the treatment given him by both Harry Frazee and
          Jd Barrow. He proved it by playing fine ball all season. But Babe has
          '?gtened to -erpent tongues. Now he would quit playing ball unless the
          ?oston club agrees to make a new contract calling for $20,000 a year.
          The Joke of the sltuatioa is that
          tarry Frasee la In pretty much of a
          " ? He has established a precedent
          W Ruth to follow by trading Carl
          is;, s to the New Tork club when the
          ubmarine funger grew tired of
          iking along with a losing club. So
          ar as Frasee ia concerned, he has
          ittlc argument to offer Ruth when
          'Bey ?ret together for a conference
          ?garehng this contract matter But
          ni? doesn't absolve Ruth, just the
          ?am?
          ?y contract with the Boston club
          an t worth a dime,'' Maya told some
          Sew York baaeball writers "I'm go

          for next year. If I don't get that
          ftsrure. I shall refuse to play ball and
          'he Boston club will have to sell my
          rei aase
          "Mays had a contract for three
          rears, but he made the Boston club
          *ei: him to the Yankees. Be Just
          luit the Red Sox and went home. If
          stave can get away with that kind of
          ?tuff you bet I can do the same.

          Tee, I signed for three years Last
          ??Bring but my contract contains the
          ten days' release clause, which makes
          ?t Illegal. If I lost an arm or a leg.
          'hey could let me go and I couldn't
          ?ret the rest of this salary.
          "I'm the best drawing card in the
          mtne no? Ty Cobb's salary is
          *r20 000 ? y??ar and I intend to net the
          ?ame money. You can say for me
          hat I shall not put on a Boston uni
          form next year if I don't receive just
          JO ?WO Iron ma."
          This must be great reading for
          those misguided fools in Boston who
          presented Battering Babe with a $500
          diamoci at the close of the season
          a? an appreciation of his great work
          for the city. Some day the fans will
          a-et the rieht angle on what profes
          sional ball players think of them.
          Then they'll cot out all those foolish
          pr?seentations of traveling bags, suits
          of clothes and diamond stick pins.
          not to speak of watches and charms.
          The players take them-?sure, why
          not. but they always have a laugh at
          the expense of the poor boobs who
          oaughed up their coin for the present.

        <text>BABE RUTH PURCHASED BY YANKEES FROM RED SOX FOR $125,000?OTHER SPORTj
          Yankees Buy Babe Ruth
          From Boston for $125,000
          Manhattan Tribe Purchase Home Run Slug
          ger From Hub City Team in Biggest Deal
          In History of Baseball.
          Boston, Jan. 5.?"Babe" Ruth, world champion home-run player
          of the Red Sox, has been bought by the New York Yankees, ac
          cording to an announcement made tonight. Harry H. Frazee, owner
          of the Red Sox, who told of the sale of Ruth, declined to name the
          price paid, but declared it was larger than had ever before been paid.
          The deal was said to have involved no other players.
          Estimates, unofficial, but said to have been based upon "inside
          information," placed the figure at which "Babe" Ruth was told at
          ,the unprecedented sum of $125,000. Efforts to have this estimate
          substantiated or denied failed, but it was generally reported that the
          figure was not far from correct.
          Highest Figure Yet Paid.
          If the estimate proves accurate, the sale of Ruth not only ele
          vates the trading of baseball players to inclusion in the category of
          sugar, shoes, clothing and other high-priced necessities, but records
          a sale at more than double the highest price heretofore paid for
          a player.
          When Alexander and Killifer were traded from Philadelphia to
          Chicago, $55,000 changed hands. The greatest price paid for a single
          player up to the trading of Ruth was said to have been the $50,000
          given for Tris Speaker when he went from the Red Sox to Cleveland.

          ever, the Bull Mm 1 ravelled Far Beyond the Fielders' Reach and "Babe" Ruth Hat Scored
          Another Home Run
          By Prof. A. L. Hodges,
          The Wc!l-Knnivn Phyticitt.
          AST Mason "I' .abe" Ruth broke all
          baseball records by hitting twenty*
          nine homo runs. Ar.l this season
          there is every indication that ho will beat
          his 11*10 total by a wide margin.
          What is tho se ret of Ruth's ability to
          make home runs with such surprising fre
          quency? ">?; it because he Is possessed of greater strength than his fellow players?
          Is it because his vision is keener or his museles better ca-ordinated? All these tilings
          doubtless have some thing to lo with it, but the real reason for thl:- iii.yionn'nal
          series of home runs sci i nee finds to be the way Xvitlx applies to his work with the bat
          certain well-known principles of physics and psychology. "But." you say. "Iluth Is a ball
          plavor. What does ho know of physics or psy chology?" Notheing, perhaps, but whether con
          sciou.ly or unconsciously Ruth applies certain well-known principles of these two sciences
          every time ho makes a homo run. Let us consider some of the many inter rsting scientific
          factors involved in bat t itig a ball. As very follower of baseball knows, a home run is
          the knocking of the ball out of the reaoli of opposing players and in .r.uch a direction
          and to nuch a distance as o make its return impossil'o before th? runner completes the
          circuit of the bases. Viewed as n mechanical proolem. the hit ting of a home run moans
          simply hitting t)i ball with the bat so as to give it great
          speed in the proper direction. The spe^l
          and direction which the bat can To made to
          give tilt; ball depend on the degree of tin
          curve which tlio pitcher has imparted to
          the ball, the weight of the ball, the. weight
          of the bat, the elasticity of the ball and
          bat. and the angle at which tin, ball iir
          pinges on the bat.
          The speed which a ball t * es on im
          mediately after its collision w'th the bat
          is a little difficult to compete because
          neither the bat nor the ball is perfectly
          elastic or perfectly non-elaaMc. To illus
          trate tlio difficulty of such a o mputation
          let mo explain what happens when per
          fectly elastic and perfectly non-elastic
          bodies come into collision.
          If two inelastic bodies?say two pieces
          of lead?of equal weight and going with
          equal speed, but in opposite directions
          meet squarely "in mid-air, they will both
          stop and fall to the ground, all theii
          energy of motion having been turned into
          heat. If, however, perfectly elastic bodler
          of the same weight going with the same
          velocity, but in opposite directions, mee?
          in mid-air, they will bounce back with
          the same velocity they had originally. 11
          one of these bodies has twice the velocity
          of the other, the latter will bounce back
          with twice its original velocity and tho
          former will bounce back only half as fast.
          All this applies to bodies having tho same
          weight. Whenever one of the colliding
          bodies is heavier than- the other, the ve
          locity given tho latter body upon bouncing
          is enormously increased.
          The bat which "Rabe" Ruth wields and
          the ball which he hits are both fairly clas
          tic; therefore, everything else being equal,
          the ball will be driven farther the heavier
          the bat and the faster the bat is moving
          as it hits the ball. Also, as tho weight of
          "Halm" Ruth' s body prevents his bat from
          doing much bouncing back, tho faster the
          ball corner, the farther It will go when ho
          hits it.
          The weight of tho ball Itself is a very
          important factor in hitting a homo run,
          viewed us a scientific problem. If thero

          were no atmosphere, everytliine be
          ing equal, the lighter tne Dall happened to
          ho the farther it would go. The friction of
          the air. however, slows the ball up con
          siderably, and this fact has to bo taken
          into consideration with several others.
          The conclusion which science reaches Is
          that the heavier tho ball is, without In
          creasing its size or decreasing Its elas
          ticity, tho farther it will go after being
          struck with tho bat.
          The direction taken by a batted ball is
          affected to some extent by the rotation of
          tho ball as it strikes the bat. Thi3 factor
          is of the neatest importance when the
          but does not strike tho ball squarely.
          It is possible for the hat to hit the ball
          in such a way that it actually increases the
          latter's rotation. In other words, it is per
          fectly possible for the batter to hit tho
          ball in such a way that it takes on a de
          cided curve. Everybody who plays golf
          knows what a common occurrence this is
          on the links. A golf hall when struck acci
          dentally oft' centre will ofton describe the
          weirdest imaginable path through the air,
          particularly if it passes through various
          air currents.
          A honr n depends to a very large ex
          tent up> ? direction given the batted
          ball. T ' ortanco of this factor 'may
          he estimated a- nine times that of tho
          speed given the hat*~d ball. 13y direction
          we mean not only the horizontal angle, but
          also the vertical angle at which tho ball
          leaves the hat. For example, no matter
          how hard the ball is hit, it will never re
          sult in a home run unit's ."t clears the
          upstretched arms of the p1 ?yers in tho
          field.
          It is plain that the direction given
          the butted ball must depend to a largo
          extent upon the manner in which the ball
          is travelling before it meets tho bat. Pro
          vided the ball is given a proper rota
          tion on its horizontal axis by the pitcher,
          the kind of curve best suited to make it
          difficult to hit it at the proper vertical
          angle is either tho down shoot or the up
          shoot. On account of the many variablo
          factors concerned science believes that any
          home run made with either of theso curve3
          is a lucky chance pure and simple.
          After the ball has boon set in motion by
          the bat with a certain speed, tho distance
          it will go depends upon the vertical angle
          at which it starts. The most desirable
          angle i3 one of 12 degrees with the ground,
          or about half a right angle. Other factors
          which determine the distance a batted ball
          will travel are the speed of the ball, its
          sphericity, the smoothness of its surface
          and its lack of rotation. Tho greater tho
          speed of the ball tho more perfectly
          spherical it is. tho smoother its surface
          and the less rotation with which it travels
          the farther it will go. Atmospheric con
          ditions, of course, enter into tho problem.
          A ball will go farther in a clear air that is
          free from moisture. Tho wind may carry
          it bodily for quite a distance or may retard
          its progress.
          If science wore asked to make it difficult
          or well-nigh impossible for "Babe" Kutli to
          Ltit a home run it would select a day w.ien
          tho barometer was high, with the air so
          heavy with moisture that it would retard
          the progress of tho batted ball. Iho
          pitcher selected would be one good on very
          alow but curvy downshootfl. If such a
          pitcher were not available, one who hid
          euch great speed that lie couid put any
          kind of a ball over the plato for tho
          batter would bo chosen. With this
          hind of a pitcher the ball is likely to
          be hit behind the plate and unlikely to bo
          started on its course at the proper angle.
          His hitting of a homo run could then bo
          mado stHI more difficult by compelling the
          redoubtable "Babe" to use a bat either so
          heavy that he could not swing it with much
          speed, or so light that it would tend to hit
          tho ball at tho wrong horizontal angle.
          There is a certain spot on the bat, usu
          ally a few inches from tho end. but vary
          ing with dlfVerent bats, which science
          knows as the centre of percussion. If the
          ball hits the bat exactly on this spot tho
          greatest effect is produced. All ball play
          ers are aware when the ball hits this spot
          on the bat, not only through the absence
          of jar to the arm, but also through a pecul
          iar satisfaction which is hard to define,
          but which is no doubt physical as well as
          mentnl.
          "Babe" Ruth's phenomenal home run rec
          ord is largely due to tho fact that, con
          sciously or unconsciously, he has found a
          way of producing the collision between
          his bat and tho ball on this centre of per
          cussion more frequently than any other
          player.
          What is called the centre of percussion
          is a principle that enters into the design
          not only ot baseball bats, but of all things
          designed for men to swing. In the ham
          mer, for example, the centre of percussion
          should be in the head. If the tool is not
          designed so that this centre is properly
          located the hammer is unsatisfactory to
          use because it jars and tires tho am too
          much.
          The problem of hitting homo runs with
          the surprising frequency that "Babe" Ruth
          does is ono more complicated in the mat
          ter of powers of Judgment and observa
          tion involved than in mechanical prin
          ciples. Viewed as a mechanical problem,
          tho home run requires a bat just as heavy
          as a player can use with comfort, tho bat
          to bo given a motion as fast as possible
          when hitting the ball, and striking the
          ball so that it wilt ho impelled into tho
          air at an anglo of approximately 42 de
          grees or half a right angle. The ball
          should also, of course, be hit at such a
          horizontal angle as not to cause a foul.
          T^lio weight of the batter has very little
          to do with tho matter of home runs, hut his
          arm muscles are a controlling factor to
          the extent of, say, fifty per cent. Of course,
          If his arms are rigid enough to make tho
          bat for all practical purposes a part of his
          body when he hits the ball, and if his body
          is swung forward at just that instant, it
          Is possible that a heavy batter, all other
          things being equal, would be able to knock
          the ball farther than a lighter player.

          To follow tho ball as it leaves the pitcher's
          hand is no easy matter, as tho sphere is
          often travelling at the rate of lf>0 feet
          a second, or nearly two milos a minuto.
          The eye movement necessary to follow it
          increases greatly as tho ball draws nearor
          and nearer the plato, owing to tho in
          crease in the angle of vision which, by the
          time the ball is over tho plate, is about
          ten times what it was when it left tho
          pitcher's hand.
          As 1 have said, tho pitcher often hurls
          the ball at the rato of 150 feet a second.
          But tho ball is travelling much faster
          than that when it leaves "Babe" Ruth's bat
          after being hit for one of tho home runs
          that have made him famous. This is in
          accordance with the laws of tho impact of
          clastic bodies.

          when one of "Babe" Ruth's
          long hits is made, the
          drops of water striking tho
          ball will bring it to the
          ground long before it
          otherwise would fall. Tho
          rain also makes the ball
          heavier, and as It contains

          on.., wo find, by applying a well known
          formula of physics, that 1,200 foot pounds
          of actual energy or work is done. Now,
          if it takes Ruth one-twentieth of a second
          to impart this energy by a swing of his bat,
          this would be at tho rate of 24,000 foot
          pounds a second, which is about forty-four
          horsepower.

          Of course, there are many psychological
          as well as mechanical factors involved in
          the hitting of tho long scries of home runs
          which "Babe" Ruth has been making for
          two seasons. The batter must bo able to
          "sense" in some manner not yet fully un
          derstood just about what kind of ball the
          pitcher is going to throw. Then he must bo
          capable of putting his body in readiness
          with lightning swiftness to meet that kind
          of ball when it passes over the plate. Tho
          player's Judgment about tho bull must bo
          made within tho smallest fraction of a sec
          ond after it leaves tho pitchpr's hand.
          Through some queer sixth sense?tne
          kinaesthotic sense, as psychologists call it
          ?all batters have tho feeling as to whether
          the trnll tho pitcher is about to throw is go
          ing to pass over the plato or not. In tho
          average batter the impressions conveyed
          by this sixth sense caunot be more than 50
          per cent accurate, but in the case of "Babe"
          Ruth, as his batting record shows, they
          must be about 90 per cent accurate. As
          everybody who plays baseball or ever
          watches a game knows, you can't strike out
          and make a homo run. and the player can
          seldom hit a home run unless the bail ha
          strikes is taking a course that would havo
          carried it straight across the plate unless
          Interrupted by his bat.
          This, then, is the secret of "Babe"
          Ruth's home runs as viewed from a scien
          tist: standpoint. A highly developed kin
          aesthetic sense enables him to "sense" the
          kind of ball the pitcher is going to throw.
          When a ball rotating on Its horizontal
          n.\is and curving most favorably for his
          purpose comes along he swings his bat at
          it with an energy sufficient to chango its
          direction and greatly increase its velocity.
          The bat Is swung in such a way that the
          centre of percussion meets the ball, send
          ing it upward at an angle of 42 degrees
          and not too far to the right or the left.
          When all these things happen the result
          should bo a home run, provided that the
          pitcher has given the ball proper speed
          and that tho wind and other atmospheric
          conditions aro favorable.</text>

        <text>"Did Babe Ruth Get Another One To-day?" | Not "How Did the Game Come Out?" *| Now the
          Great American Question 4
          By W? O. McGeehan
          IF THE lata lamented Shakes?
          peare were a' baseball writer he
          might usa a line that he
          wested upon some more or less
          obscure hero of antiquity and say of
          "Babe" Ruth, "He doth bestride the
          narrow baseball fields like a Colos?
          sus." For "Babe" Ruth is Hercules
          and Thor reincarnated, the Colossus
          of Swat. His bat is the club of
          Hercules and the hammer of Thor,
          the symbol of sheer, primitive might
          before which the puny folk bow and
          offer worship.
          But for the game of baseball, the
          youngest game of the youngest peo?
          ple, George Herman Ruth, the
          "Babe" Ruth who dwarfs all other
          personalities in the daily news,
          might have been a peaceful cigar
          maker or perhaps a third-rate
          heavyweight pugilist instead of the
          national idol of the American people.
          The "Babe" was Fortune's dar?
          ling, though Fortune concealed her
          great and kindly intentions as far as
          he was concerned when the "Babe"
          was 2. boy. For the "Babe" was
          born left-hander!. Hercules was a
          right-hander. Thor never was pic?
          tured as wielding his hammer from
          the port side. None of the heroes of
          antiquity, as far as can be ascer?
          tained, was a southpaw. Harry Leon
          Wilson was the first novelist to put a
          left-hander in the near-hero class,
          and he i ;d it in a half-hearted
          fashion.
          Moreover, little George Herman
          Ruth was a half-orphan at a very
          early age and was sent to an insti?
          tution for orphans. He was nearly
          an orphan boy, and, according to
          the San ford and Merton books, he
          should have taken a morbid sort of
          point of view at an early age and
          learned something useful. But the
          youth of "Babe" Ruth was applied
          mostly to the study of the great
          American game of baseball.
          You are not going to draw any
          conventional moral from the early
          boyhood of "Babe" Ruth. He was
          not a particularly industrious or
          thrifty lad, chockful of conventional
          virtues. He was just a normal,
          chuckle-headed combination of Tom
          Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He
          Was Just natural and just human.
          FORTUNATELY the boyhood of
          "Babe" Ruth was intrusted to
          men who understand human
          nature, and particularly the human
          boy?the Christian Brothers, of Bal?
          timore. The fraternity is not limited
          to Baltimore. It is all over the
          *orld. It is made up of big-hearted

          ; is the rise of "Babe" Ruth. The Al-,
          | ger heroes became mere bankers or
          traction magnates, but George Her
          | man Ruth, the waif of Baltimore, be?
          came "Babe" Ruth, at whose shrine
          ' bankers and traction magnates burn
          incense. Ever and anon these jaded
          near-successes pick up the tape, not
          to see the condition of the market,
          but to learn whether the latest is the
          forty-fifth or forty-sixth home run
          ! knocked out by the "Babe" for the
          I season.
          And these heroes envy "Babe"
          ! Ruth the left-handed, the boy who
          ! was regarded as far from bright in
          ;his classes. For the "Babe" can hit
          them out with the joyous freedom of
          Hei-culcs swinging his club or Thor
          throwing his hammer through the'
          clouds. All the tricks of the pitchers
          are vain when he faces them, and all
          the walls of the baseball parks are
          lowered when his bat crashes against
          the baseball. Homer would have
          loved him if the blind singer had had
          a season pass to the Polo Grounds.
          THAT Ruth is the greatest bat?
          ter of them all is admitted by
          two members of the old Orioles;
          and when two members of the old
          Orioles agree upon anything, that
          makes it official and irrefutable. If
          there is anybody so ignorant of im?
          portant American history that he
          does not know who the old Orioles
          are, we will explain, more in pity
          than in indignation, that the old
          Orioles were members of the great?
          est baseball team of a generation or
          so ago.
          The two Orioles who made the ad?
          mission that "Babe" Ruth was the
          greatest baseball player in the whole
          world are Wilbert Robinson, mana?
          ger of the Brooklyn National League
          baseball team, and Joseph Kelly,
          scout for the Yankees. Both of these
          gentlemen are grandfathers and citi?
          zens of high repute in the city where
          they dwell, which also happens to i
          be the home of "Babe" Ruth. "Wil-1
          bert Robinson was a catcher, and still
          ; holds the world's record for consecu?
          tive base hits in one game. Joseph
          Kelly was an outfielder of sorts on
          the old Orioles, and his present oc-1
          cupation is "ivory hunting," looking
          upon baseball playera and appraising
          them ?at their true > jrtb to their
          employers and to the national pas?
          time.
          These two authorities admitted" to
          me in th? presence of witnesses that
          never, even in the days of the old
          Orioles, was there a baseball player
          who could hit like "Babe" Ruth. Con?
          sider the importance of this admis?
          sion. The members of the old Ori?
          oles are the most conservative per?
          sons in th vorld. Never before
          have they au. : ..ed that any player
          of the present was anywhere near as
          wonderful as tl\e players of their
          glorious day.
          "He can hit them harder than any?
          body, and he can hit them oftener,"
          they admitted from the fullness of
          their hearts. They did not qualify
          the statement, They did ?ob assert
          that the pitchers were less canny
          and that the ball parks were smaller.
          They admitted that the heroes of
          their day were lost in the shadow of
          the Colossus of Swat. They admitted
          that even in the days when the old
          Orioles were young "Babe" Ruth
          would have loomed up above them
          all.
          That Ruth broke all big league
          records for home run getting last
          year is in the book. That he has
          broken his own record this year and
          is on the way to setting a mark far
          beyond the misty horizons ?if the
          baseball world is l?o\vn. But the
          old Orioles have explained away the
          performances of other more modern
          heroes of baseball. Ruth's achieve?
          ments they Jrott ungrudgingly.,
          That is almost as marvelous as the
          achievements themselves.
          .
          ONCE upon a time the youth of
          this land worshiped another
          young giant, a right-hander
          and an exponent of another and el?
          der sport?John L. Sullivan. The
          right arm of John L. ?Sullivan was
          mighty in its day, but the left arm i
          of "Babe" Ruth is mightier in its I
          day and generation in the matter of
          sheer numbers of worshipers.
          | They used to block the corridors
          of the hotels, and even the streets,1
          ? to see the mighty John L. pass. They
          do that in the case of "Babe" Ruth,
          I too. It is not for me to disparage
          | the memory of John L. Sullivan, the
          | gladiator, in th? days-cf hi? greatest
          -?
          ring glory, but I think, that his ad?
          mirers saw that particular John L.
          through rose glasses and that they
          worshiped an illusion.
          The John L. Sullivan of the later !
          day, the John L. who beat down his ?
          own worst enemy and lifted up his ;
          self-respect from the muck, was the
          John L. that should have been wor- ;
          shiped, for that John L. Sullivan :
          was a mighty gladiator. The John ,
          L. Sullivan who knocked out ring an- j
          tagonists with a right-hand punch to j
          the jaw was a mere mass of brawn ?
          and muscle, but the gray and fat old |
          John L. who conquered himself was i
          the true fighter.
          But we are considering the John L.
          that was the popular idol, the '
          brawny man who was followed by '
          the men and the boys and cheered
          when he stalked abroad. He was !
          not a particularly affable character.
          This big "Babe" Ruth is a far
          more likable person. He is full of i
          good nature and the joy of living.
          He is a modest enough young man, :
          and he knows his limitations, though ;
          he acknowledges no limitations as j
          far as the baseball diamonds and j
          the fences around them are con
          cerned. He is not falsely modest to
          the point of affectation, for he has
          that supreme confidence in himself
          that comes after certain achievement.
          But he will not play to the gallery
          consciously. He likes the gallery
          and he understands it, and he likes
          to have it understand him. ?
          Ruth is, perhaps, too simple, or
          it may be too wise, to try to fool his
          gallery, as other stars of his own ;
          game or stars in other lines of en?
          deavor have tried to do in vain. For
          nobody can fool his gallery. No
          truly wise man ever tried.
          THE best judges of a man ar?
          the men with whom he works !
          or with whom he plays.
          "Babe" Ruth, naturally, is the high?
          est salaried ballplayer on the New
          York Yankees. He might, if he were
          like some of the stars of baseball or i
          stars of some of the arts, claim all
          the privileges of a star and hold
          himself aloof from his fellow players.
          Here again is the simplicity or the
          wisdom of "Babe" Ruth. He plays
          the game with the team and for the
          team, and the men ' he plays with
          know it and appreciate it. "Babe'
          Ruth will even make the "college
          try" to get a base on an impossible
          chance. The "cdllege try" is the vet?
          eran professional's term of contempt
          for zealous endeavor that seems fu?
          tile on the facts of it.
          _ an the "Babe" *nake?th? two
          owners of the Yankees, Colonels I
          Ruppert and Huston, shudder with !
          apprehension when he hurls himself
          against a wall to get a fly ball, or I
          when he throws his huge bulk
          through the air in the effort to steal i
          a base. They rejoice in his spirit
          and his wholehearted way of play?
          ing, but at the same time they per?
          spire with apprehension lest some?
          thing should happen that would de?
          prive them of the most expensive in?
          vestment in professional baseball.
          Some stars have disrupted base?
          ball teams, rousing jealousies, but
          "Babe" Ruth, admittedly the great?
          est star of them all, has made the
          Yankees a team. The advent of the
          "Babe" has brought them the chance
          of that "world's scries dough," which
          should be something like $7,000 a
          player. It has also made them the
          team of the big leagues. They do not
          begrudge the "Babe" the homage
          that is paid him. As far as Ruth
          is concerned, there is no professional
          jealousy on the Yankee team.
          Just to what extent the present
          prosperity of professional baseball
          is due to "Babe" Ruth I would not
          care to say, but it is considerable
          When I first trailed West with tht
          Yankees, they told me in Chicagc
          that there had been little or no in
          tereat in the Chicago White Sox. Bu
          I when the Yankees came ta Cbicagi
          they turned out to the extent of 20,
          000 a day and upward to see the
          "Babe" "bust one."
          Once, with the score 2 to 1 in the
          eighth and a tense pitchers' duelen,
          the Chicago pitcher passed "Babe"
          Ruth. Ten thousand people started
          to walk out of Comiskey Park.
          There remained yet the chance of
          the melodramatic ninth inning rally,
          but the ten thousand had lost all
          interest in the game for the after?
          noon. It was clear thatr they were
          not going to see "Babe" Ruth knock
          a home run, and nothing else mat?
          tered.
          Civic pride, inter-city rivalry, in?
          terest in the national game were
          minor considerations. The "Babe"
          was not due to "bust one."
          IN CLEVELAND 1 was talking
          to two tired business men early
          in the afternoon.
          Said one of them gravely:
          "This 'Babe' Ruth is a menace. He
          is responsible to a large degree for
          i the lack of production in these
          : manufacturing towns around the
          Lakes. Go out to the ball park to?
          day and you will see thousands of
          young men taking the afternoon off
          just to see 'Babe' Ruth 'bust one.'

          Gestapo revolutloi ary conspirators led by
          Leon Trotsky was charged Saturday
          by Pravda, communist party organ.
          The plot. Pravda said, was aimed
          primarily against Dictator Joseph
          Stalin.
          "We know now there was a direct

          TROTZky AND STALIN
          HATED RIVALS
          NEW YORK, Aug. 15. (A*)—If Leon
          Trotzky is behind a terroristic plot
          against the Soviet government, as
          charged in Moscow, It will not be the
          first time that "the Napoieon ol
          bolshevism" has tried to drive from
          power his hated rival. Dictator
          Joseph Stalin.
          Alter Lenii.'s death, Stalin seized
          arid held the dictatorship which
          Trotzky claimed for himself. The
          battle which ensued between these
          personalities has provided one of
          the landmarks of history.
          train oi irouoie
          For the past fifteen years, nearly
          ten of which have been spent in
          exile, Trotzky has directed his
          flaming shafts at Stalin from hid
          den places.
          Trotzky always has been a revolu
          tionist. His real name was Lebei
          Bron-tein and he was born in Kher
          son. Russia, in 1877, tne son of a
          Jewish chemist. He began his revolt
          against society at the age of 15
          when he was expelled from school
          on the charge of having desecrated
          a sacred ikon, an image of the
          orthodox Russian church.
          He was exiled to Siberia twice
          but escaped each time.
          He went abroad, and left a trail
          of trouble behind him.
          He was expelled from one country
          after another. Finally he came to
          New York where he struggled for
          wufeiej ce until he returned to Russia
          to join the revolution.
          Beaten Out by Stalin
          From being "just a man of the
          streets,” Trotzky rose rapidly in
          power until he was second only to
          Lenin. Trotzky appeared the logical
          successor to the dictator, and made
          no secret of the fact that he so re
          garded himself. However, he over
          looked another ai d stronger leader
          —Joseph Stalin.
          When Lenin was stricken with
          paralysis. Trotzky assumed virtual
          dictatorship, but he did not hold it
          long. After Lenin died, Stalin as
          sumed power. There lollowed a
          fierce warfare between the two,
          until Stalin finally forced his op
          ponent into exile in Turkey.</text>

        <text>Some years ago Time magazine
          in an article dealing with Joseph
          Stalin quoted him as saying:
          “American efficiency is that in
          domitable spirit which neither
          knows nor will be deterred by any
          obstacle, which plugs away with
          businesslike perseverance until
          every impediment has been re
          moved that simply must go
          through with a job once it has
          been tackled.”
          Over the years, Stalin has had
          the opportunity to realize that he
          knew what he was talking about.
          Americans have demonstrated ef
          fectively their ability to rise above
          obstacles, win wars, and still pos
          sess enough physical and material
          wherewithal to try and hold the
          world together until social plan
          ners would-be Neroes, and others
          of their ilk run out of ideas and
          blood letting.
          You were quite right 25 years
          ago when you said that we Amer
          icans who were on the job would
          plug away with businesslike per
          serverance to remove impediments
          to our liberty, Joseph Stalin. We

          Another thing, Joseph Stalin,
          and on this fact and its accept
          ance hangs our American destiny:
          We know that American business
          may very well be the way of hu
          ran victory. In the hands of men
          dedicated to the principles of free
          do-n. the production lines of
          America are securing the freedom
          of men and women everywhere.
          The production of goods is giving
          the good things of life to Amer
          icans at the same time. This is
          the fantasy that Joseph Stalin,
          Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and
          the ailing Eva Peron could not
          read or comprehend: Free people
          produce goods and freedom from
          the same bolt of liberty.</text>

          Malenkov Pledges
          Red Peace Policy
          At Stalin’s Funeral
          MOSCOW, UP)—Over the bier of
          Joseph Stalin, his successor Geo
          rgi M. Malenkov pledged the So
          viet Union Monday “to strengthen
          by every means the might of the
          Soviet armed forces,” but de
          clared his foreign policy is one
          of peace.
          Both Malenkov and Laventi P.
          Beria, in funeral orations, praised
          the “heroic Korean people.” Mal
          enkov said a “mighty camp of
          peace, democracy and socialism
          has been set up” under Stalin,
          and he counted the Chinese peo
          ple as in that camp.
          After the orations, Stalin’s body
          was placed in Lenin’s tomb on
          Red square—the tomb to whose
          top Stalin invited Gen. Dwight D.
          Eisenhower in 1945 when he
          visited Moscow.
          The funeral lasted an hour and
          a half and took place outdoors
          in windy Red Square with the
          temperature around 12. Somber
          music by a band of 750 pieces set
          the tone. Stalin’s body—he died
          Thursday at the age of 74 after
          a brain hemorrhage—was brought
          from the hall of columns, set
          down before Soviet leaders come
          to praise him, and then gently
          placed in the Lenin mausoleum.

          Stalin’s Last Days
          Editor's Note Eddy Gilmore
          went to Moscow in 1941 for The
          Associated Press and remained
          there for the last 12 years of
          Joseph Stalin’s life. Today, on the
          fifth anniversary of Stalin’s death,
          he recalls the last chapter in the
          dictator’s career.
          By EDDY GILMORE
          LONDON MB—The telephone jan
          gled at 4 o’clock a few hours be
          fore a cold Moscow dawn.
          A Russian voice ahnounced the
          startling news that Joseph Stalin
          was critically ill.
          I jumped out of bed, pulled on
          my clothes and raced down an icy
          street looking for a taxi.
          This was one of the greatest
          news stories in the world. If
          Stalin were not dying, a Soviet
          official would never have
          bothered to tip off a foreign cor
          respondent.
          The immediate job was to reach
          Moscow’s Central Telegraph Of
          fice and get the news through cen
          sorship to newspapers and radio
          stations beyond the Iron Curtain.
          I shook the sleep out of a dozing
          taxi driver.
          "Centralny Telegraf,” I told
          him, "and please go by the Krem-
          Golf Club Gets
          Purchase Offer
          On Local Course
          A New York real estate broker
          has advised the Key West Golf
          Club that he has a wealthy cli
          ent who would like to purchase
          the course.
          In a letter to the local club of
          ficials, Robert Lee Oshman, 507
          Fifth Ave., New York, wrote:
          “I have a millionaire client who
          wishes to buy your famous golf
          club and give you a handsome
          profit.
          “You can truly have your cake
          and eat it by selling controlling
          interest in your golf club for a
          good price and still enjoy con
          tinued active membership parti

          operative millionaire who loves
          golf and the golfing ira.ernuy
          who play the game."
          The letter was read by Club
          President Glen Dale during a
          meeting of club members last
          night and the membership voted
          to turn the letter over to the
          city manager since the course is
          municipally owned.

          lin on your way. And tovarich, go

          Behind the crenelated walls of
          this ancient building a ruthless
          ruler of 200 million people lay
          dying.
          1 thought of an old R ua s i a n
          saying: “Over Moscow stands the
          Kremlin, but over the Kremlin
          stand only the stars.”
          Though he controlled the des
          tines of an entire nation and the
          peace of the world, death was
          coming to Joseph Stalin as it
          comes to all men.
          It was February five years
          ago.
          Until the early morning of
          March 5, the Soviets put out medi
          cal bulletins on the dictator’s los
          ing struggle for life.
          Then, on that freezing March 5,
          Suit Seeks To Block Revision
          Constitution Faces
          Early Legal Battle
          TALLAHASSEE 144—A legal at
          tack on Florida’s proposed new
          Constitution has been set for a
          hearing in Leon County Circuit
          Court March 14. Judge Hugh M.
          Taylor will hear the case.
          Rafael A. Rivera-Cruz, Miami
          attorney, filed the suit in an effort
          to keep the proposed revision off
          the November general election bal
          lot.
          Rivera-Cruz contended that the
          daisy-chain interlocking require
          ment of the new document is un
          constitutional. He is asking an in
          junction to prevent Secretary of
          State Gray from certifying the
          revision articles to the counties
          for inclusion on the ballot.
          Asst. Atty. Gen. Wilson Wright
          said the state probably will make
          its answer in the form of a motion
          to dismiss the suit.
          The Miami lawyer contended
          that the revised articles, which
          the Legislature adopted as a pack
          age to be ratified by the people
          as a whole, is actually a general
          revision of the existing Constitu
          tion.
          He said the present 1865 Consti
          tution provides that general re
          vision of the state’s basic law
          must be accomplished by a con
          stitutional convention of delegates
          elected by the people, instead of
          by tbs Legislature.
          came the word: "Joseph Stalin Is
          dead.’
          The broad streets of the Soviet
          capital were almost deserted at
          that early hour, but lights blazed
          inside the Kremlin.
          Hundreds of cars were parked
          outside its walls. Inside, members
          of the Communist party's Central
          Committee were meeting, and
          there could have been but a few
          among them who, down deep in
          their hearts, mourned this man’s
          death.
          For no matter how exalted his
          position, every Communist official
          always knew that the knock on his
          door in the middle of the night
          might be from Stalin’s secret
          police.</text>

          lent calling for a cessation of vio
          nt methods In collectivizing fir
          ea santa.
          As if by magic, the political at
          mosphere in tens of thousands of
          villages in this vast country became
          milder. Immediately the entire
          press—until then silent about in
          stances of terror, injustice and cor
          ruption which had developed in
          driving millions of peasants into
          collective farms—began to expose
          these “mistakes.”
          Faded Hopes Revived
          Most remarkable of ail was the
          afreet of Stalin's words upon the
          state of mind here. Faded hopes
          began to revive. A torrent of too
          optimistic rumors began to inundate
          he portion of the population which
          s suffering under the Kremlin’s
          aggrressive drive for Socialism.
          There was talk of a “new nep,” of
          Stalin going back to Lenin’s real
          ism,” and the like.
          Although Stalin’s statement is re
          lieving the pressure in the villages,
          its significance must not be exag
          gerated.
          There is no justification for the
          assumption in some circles here and
          in some of the foreign press that
          this means a "retreat” from the
          Kremlin’s policy of aggression
          against the village kulaks or the
          city Nepmen.
          The intense effort of recent
          months unavoidably has stirred up
          resentment and dissatisfaction. It
          is the purpose of the Stalin leader
          ship to soothe these feelings, to
          “permit a breathing space.” But it
          does not, so far as present indica
          tions go.amean in any sense a sur
          render of the principal aims of the
          recent drive.
          Violence to Be Corrected
          “The task of the party,” Stalin
          said at the very’ outset in his pro
          nunciamento, “Is to solidify the suc
          cesses already achieved and to use
          them in a planned way for further
          progress."</text>
